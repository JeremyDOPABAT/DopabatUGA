abstract = "Laser direct metal deposition (DMD) is an efficient and flexible additive manufacturing technique which has broad application prospects, but it is also limited due to defects and mechanical anisotropy. Laser remelting (LR) is a process that after each layer is deposited, re-scan the deposition layer with the same slice data but without powder deliver, and it is often used during selective laser melting. Herein, LR process has been applied during the DMD process of a 17-4 PH steel to enhance the densification level and relieve the mechanical anisotropy. It is found that the thermal history, porosity and microstructural evolution are dependent on the LR energy density. Moreover, the roughness of top surface of the deposited layer and intralayer porosity decrease with increase of the laser remelting energy density. While for interlayer defects, there is an optimal LR energy density corresponding to the lowest interlayer porosity. Furthermore, LR process can enhance the holding time at high temperature, even sometimes heat the sample above Ac1, resulting in change in contents of austenite and carbide. In addition, LR process greatly dilutes the pre-solidified texture. It was also proved that the flat defects in-plane to the interlayer and the anisotropy of the crystallographic orientations are extremely harmful for the mechanical isotropy of the DMDed samples. Finally, sample manufactured with laser remelting at 15.0 J/mm2 has the lowest porosity and most random crystallographic orientations resulting in near isotropous tensile strength, but the contribution of laser remelting to eliminate anisotropy in elongation is limited because of the interlayer defects."

abstract = "High-efficiency, large-area, non-destructive, and high-precision polishing of alumina ceramics was achieved by picosecond laser in an overlapping parallel line scanning mode. The ablation law and the ablation threshold during polishing were determined. The surface roughness (SRa) after polishing was decreased by 82% compared with that of the unpolished sample (1.80 μm) and the minimum SRa achieved was 0.32 μm, when the laser energy density was 5.09 J/cm2, scan rate was 800 mm/s, and scanning path gap was 10 μm. The polishing efficiency, which was described by the processing area per second, was 55 mm2/s. The mechanism of picosecond laser polishing was not direct removal of surface material, but entailed the recrystallization of nanoparticles excited by the ultrafast laser. The excited nanoparticles melted and recrystallized to form a layer of dense fine crystal structure on the ceramic surface, which resulted in the decreased SRa."

In this paper, a future intense laser ion accelerator is discussed to make the laser-based ion accelerator compact and controllable. The issues in the laser ion accelerator include the energy efficiency from the laser to the ions, the ion beam collimation, the ion energy spectrum control, the ion beam bunching, and the ion particle energy control. The energy efficiency from the laser to ions is improved by using a solid target with a fine sub-wavelength structure. The ion beam collimation is performed by larger holes behind the solid target. An ion beam bunching and a post-acceleration are successfully realized by a multi-stage laser-target interaction. The controllable laser ion acceleration would become viable based on the study discussed in this paper. In this paper, we present 3D PIC simulation results for the controllability of laser ion acceleration system."

abstract = "Removing the oxide film and dirt on the surface of the aluminium alloy can improve the welding quality of the aluminium alloy. In this paper, the characteristics of picosecond and 100 nanosecond pulsed laser cleaning aluminium alloys are explored by changing the average laser power, spot overlap ratio and scanning trajectory overlap rate. The results show that the oxide laser removal depth and diameter are related to the average power. As the average laser power increases, the depth and diameter of the ablation pit increase. At the same average power, the nanosecond laser ablation depth is greater than the picosecond laser. To achieve good surface quality, the nanosecond laser requires a higher overlap rate than the picosecond laser. The high overlap rate results in a nanosecond laser cleaning efficiency that is much lower than that of a picosecond laser. More importantly, the surface quality obtained by picosecond laser cleaning is much better than nanosecond laser cleaning. In addition, the welding experiment shows that the laser cleaning pre-treatment can effectively improve the welding quality."

abstract = "In this paper, the thermal analysis of the high-power diode laser hardening process was modeled on AISI 4130 steel. Afterward, the depth and width of hardness were predicted based on the complete austenite temperature (AC3). Due to the dimensions and output beam power of the diode laser stack (DLS), it is impossible to achieve the suitable power density (103-105 W/cm2). Furthermore, the output intensity profile of the DLS is not homogeneous because of the pitch between the emitters. Thus, to achieve a suitable power density and a uniform beam profile, an optical layout was designed. The beam profile was experimentally obtained by a beam profiler at different distances from the focal plane and was compared with the modeling results. Due to the agreement between the modeling and experimental results, the intensity value of each mesh of the laser profile was extracted from the ZEMAX software. Then, for the thermal analysis of the laser hardening process (LHP), it was entered as a heat flux input into the COMSOL Multiphysics software."

The 1.08 μm CFBG is used as a reflector of the fiber oscillator and the FBG is used as an in-core temperature on-line monitor of the laser simultaneously. According to the temperature characteristics of the FBG, the real-time inner temperature can be obtained by detecting the shift of the reflection spectrum. Experimental results have proved the effectiveness of the proposed temperature monitor, which can give the temperature inside a fiber laser comparing to the normal surface measurement techniques such as infrared (IR) camera. This paper provides a simple method to detect the local in-core temperature of fiber lasers, which is useful for investigations of high-power fiber lasers system."

The charge density difference and partial density of states (PDOS) carried out by density functional theory (DFT) calculations predict the graphene with lattice imperfection can induce virtual bound states at the vacancy sites and Fermi level shift compared to perfect graphene. The surface defects density of laser generated graphene is characterized by nanoscale electrical measurements using the conductive atomic force microscope (c-AFM). The corresponding current–voltage (I–V) curves show that the electronic charge transfers, thereby electrical conductivities of laser generated graphene, are influenced by the lattice defects. The defect densities are tunable by change laser fluence and pulse number. This research provides an understanding of the interfacial transport properties between laser generated graphene and 4H-SiC through a detailed analysis of surface defects."

The LIDT of Ti alloy were obviously lower than those of Al alloy, while the Ti alloy have a higher ablation rate than Al alloy under the same ablation laser fluence. The ablation threshold depends on pulse numbers, which is mainly due to the incubation effects. The deduced incubation coefficients of Ti alloy and Al alloy are 0.80 ± 0.08 and 0.84 ± 0.03, respectively. Furthermore, the morphologies of the ablation craters were observed by scanning electron microscope (SEM). The laser-induced periodic surface structures (LIPSS) at the edge of the craters on Ti alloy were observed. The ablation mechanisms of Ti alloy and Al alloy were also discussed."

Irreversible ceramic-like polycrystalline microstructures were formed in filamentary traces, and the phase transition from α-Al2O3 to γ-Al2O3 directly reflected the thermal effect of picosecond laser filamentation. According to the filamentary characteristics, a continuous filamentary channel with a uniform diameter of 33 μm and a length of 7443 μm was obtained by gradually raising the focal position.
