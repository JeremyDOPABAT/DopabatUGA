abstract={We present an efficient monolithic fiber laser incorporating fiber Bragg grating (FBG) mirrors inscribed directly into the active fiber using a femtosecond laser. The FBGs are inscribed in an erbium/ytterbium co-doped fiber using the direct-write, plane-by-plane femtosecond laser inscription method, which allows for complete spatial control of the refractive index change in the fiber core. This approach offers a significant advantage, as we eliminate the fiber splices typically required between the active and passive fibers that would, otherwise, incorporate the FBG. The gratings were characterized in transmission and reflection, and the performance of the fiber laser was recorded when the fiber was coiled into a circular and kidney shape. The kidney shape of the fiber coil improved the laser slope efficiency, as the inner cladding of the active fiber had a circular shape. Our results show that the control of the grating inscription parameters using the plane-by-plane inscription method can result in an efficient monolithic fiber laser.},

pages={1135-1137},
abstract={We report a high-power optically-pumped vertical-external-cavity surface-emitting laser emitting at around 1180 nm. The free-running laser produced 72 W of output power at a heatsink temperature of 0°C and 53 W near room temperature (20°C). The GaAs-based gain mirror was bonded to a 2-mm-thick diamond attached to a TEC-cooled copper mount in order to enable efficient heat extraction for high-power operation. Moreover, the spectrum of the laser was narrowed down to 0.06 nm by employing a combination of a birefringent filter and an etalon inside the cavity which yielded a maximum of 19 W at a heatsink temperature of 20°C. The demonstration opens a new perspective for the realisation of sodium laser guide star adaptive optics employing frequency doubling of 1180 nm radiation.},

title={A Compact Laser Imaging System for Concurrent Reflectance Confocal Microscopy and Laser Doppler Flowmetry},

pages={1-9},
abstract={We propose a compact laser feedback interferometry imaging system for concurrent reflectance confocal microscopy and laser Doppler flowmetry. This system acquires both confocal reflectance and Doppler signals in a confocal architecture to image dynamic turbid media with higher contrast than a system operating in either modality and is coherent in nature. In a confocal optical configuration, reflectance confocal microscopy provides information about scattering from within a small volume centered around the focal point of the confocal system, and laser Doppler flowmetry provides information about the velocity of moving scatterers within the same volume. Raster scanning the sample enables the concurrent creation of two images, containing independent information, from a well-specified depth within the sample. Concurrent spatial mapping of these independent sensing modalities affords improvement in the capability of the imaging system by obtaining additional information from both morphological and functional features of the dynamic turbid medium at depths penetrable by near-infrared lasers. We realize the idea using a laser feedback interferometry imaging system scanning a microfluidic channel that contains a dynamic turbid medium. We show the effectiveness of this integrated imager quantitatively through the improvement of the signal-to-background ratio of a combined (multiplication) image.},

title={Broadband Laser Doppler Frequency Shift Emulator for Satellite Laser Communication},
year={2019},

pages={1-12},
abstract={A novel emulator of laser Doppler frequency shift (DFS) for satellite laser communication based on microwave photonics technology is proposed and experimentally demonstrated. In order to overcome the bottleneck that the optical frequency shift signal with a wide frequency offset from near zero can hardly be obtained using traditional electro-optic or acousto-optic frequency shifting, the frequency of laser signal is first moved to a lower/higher fixed frequency and then shifted back to a higher/lower tunable frequency. The signal after cascaded frequency shifting in the opposite direction is equivalent to the original laser signal with DFS. In the experiment, the value and direction of DFS correspond to the magnitude and sign of the difference between the two frequency shifts. The DFS from -14 GHz to +14 GHz with a varying rate of 323 MHz/s is accurately implemented. In addition, the side mode suppression ratio (SMSR) of laser signals with DFS are all over 52.3 dB. The proposed scheme is significant to evaluate and test the DFS compensation capability of the satellite laser communication terminal.},

title={Electroabsorption Modulated Lasers With High Immunity to Residual Facet Reflection by Using Lasers With Partially Corrugated Gratings},
year={2017},
volume={9},
number={2},
pages={1-16},
abstract={Residual facet reflection can significantly degrade the performance of electroabsorption modulated lasers (EMLs) operating at high data rates. This issue also complicates the fabrication and characterization of the highly demanded light sources for optical interconnects and transmission. It is desired to optimize the device structure to make EMLs robust and immune to residual facet reflection. EMLs with a partially corrugated-grating DFB section are designed and optimized to have much improved tolerance to the residual optical reflection from the modulator output facet. By designing the laser section with an appropriate grating length and linear gain coefficient, the EML can have good tolerance to residual facet reflection. The analysis indicates that 100% yield can be obtained with the optimal design. If the EML needs to operate over a wide ranges of gain coefficient and facet reflection, >70% of yield can still be obtained.},

title={Selective Boron Emitters Using Laser-Induced Forward Transfer Versus Laser Doping From Borosilicate Glass},
year={2017},
volume={7},
number={5},
pages={1254-1263},
abstract={Although highly doped boron selective emitters (SEs) can be formed by using laser doping (LD) from the borosilicate glass remaining after boron tribromide tube diffusion, the dopant concentration is limited. This limitation can be overcome by using a laser-induced forward transfer (DLIFT) approach. In this work, SEs formed by DLIFT and LD are compared to a homogenous tube diffusion (Diff) emitter. We investigated the correlation of the emitter saturation current density (j0e) and the specific contact resistance (?c) with the sheet resistance (Rsheet) and the laser pulse energy density (Ep,d). For passivated emitters, j0e of DLIFT and LD emitters was around ten times higher than j0e of Diff emitters. For metallized emitters, simulated j0e of DLIFT emitters was lower than j0e of LD and Diff emitters for Rsheet glt; 40.0 O/sq. Moreover, we show how j0e can be further reduced by increasing the surface dopant concentration of the boron emitter and by reducing the laser-induced defects in the silicon crystal. Additionally, the metallization of DLIFT emitters with aluminum-silver paste by screen printing provided low contact resistances between metal and silicon (?c <; 1.0 mO · cm2). Thus, p-type emitters can be optimized by forming an SE with the highly doped boron regions achieved by DLIFT under the screen-printed metallization.},

abstract={FS-laser irradiation at high repetition pulse rate enables producing high-performance passive waveguides in different glasses through the local modification of the glass composition. In this paper, we show that this mechanism can similarly be used to produce high-performance waveguide amplifiers and lasers. Furthermore, we show the feasibility of producing active waveguides with different optical gains in the same phosphate glass sample by changing the laser writing parameters. The lanthanides present in the glass composition (Er3+, Yb3+ , and La3+, the refractive index carrying element) experience similar local concentration changes upon fs-laser writing, enabling to determine the concentration of La3+ and thus the refractive index contrast of the guiding region by measuring its absorption at 1534 nm. The produced waveguide lasers show slope efficiencies (respect to the absorbed pump power) above 38%, which could reach up to 42% by further optimization of the waveguide laser cavity configuration. The active waveguides produced are thermally stable for temperatures up to at least 450 °C.},

abstract={The process of generation of a high-frequency train of laser pulses in laser-thyristors (LTs) based on AlGaAs/GaAs heterostructures with various optical activation efficiencies has been studied. It was found that the main factors affecting the frequency and peak power of the laser pulses are the charging current of the barrier capacitance of the collector p-n junction and the holding current. The charging current of the barrier capacitance determines the condition for an LT to pass to the uncontrollable turn-on mode. The holding current determines the condition for the transition of an LT to the sticking mode in the turned-on state. It was shown that the holding current reached a value of 0.2 mA for the LT heterostructure with high optical activation efficiency, which limited the maximum repetition frequency to 470 kHz at a peak power of 4 W. A decrease in the optical activation efficiency made it possible to raise the holding current to 100 mA, with the maximum repetition frequency reaching as a result 12 MHz at a peak power of 0.7 W. Lowering the repetition frequency to 8 MHz made it possible to raise the peak power to 3.2 W at a pulse width of 17 ns.},

abstract={The advent of many-core processors with hundreds of processing cores collocated on single silicon dies requires scalable and efficient on-chip interconnects. Research suggests conventional electrical interconnects will be inadequate to support large-scale many-core processors. Thus, emerging technologies such as on-chip silicon nanophotonics may help meet the demands of future many-core processors by providing high-bandwidth and low-power communication over extended distances. Nanophotonic interconnects require a large external laser source which is often wasted during periods of low network utilization. We propose laser pooling techniques, where we share laser power among all the nodes and effectively share the link bandwidth and power. Furthermore, we design both static and dynamic techniques to scale laser power with network load. Evaluation and simulations of the proposed architecture estimate the proposed architecture, powering 16 optical channels with 0.5 dB/cm waveguide cladding losses, would require only 5.1 W of laser power versus 12.3 W of laser power for the baseline architecture, almost 58.5% laser power savings, while incurring only a 22% saturation throughput penalty.},

abstract={In this paper, we demonstrate the use of regenerated chirped grating (RCG)-Michelson interferometer for the measurement of laser beam intensity profile. When the grating is exposed to CO2 laser irradiation, heat is generated in the fiber due to the absorption of the laser by the glass fiber. The RCG is manufactured from an 18-mm long seed chirped grating through a thermal annealing treatment, to enhance its thermal resistance and durability against the high temperature induced by the CO2 laser irradiation. The intensity profile of the incident laser on the grating can be determined from the phase shift derivative function calculated from the output spectra of the interferometer. By scanning the grating across the laser beam, a 2-D intensity profile of the CO2 laser can be attained.},
