abstract={Summary form only given. Quantum networks offer opportunities for the exploration of physical systems that have not heretofore existed in the natural world with applications to quantum computation, communication, metrology, and quantum many-body physics [1]. As illustrated in Fig. 1, a quantum network is created by generating and storing quantum states locally in quantum nodes. These nodes interact over quantum channels to enable entanglement to be spread across the network.In my presentation [2], I will provide an overview of quantum networks from formal to physical. I will discuss research at Caltech for the laboratory realization of small networks composed of atoms that interact strongly by way of single photons [3-6]. The goal is to achieve lithographic quantum optical circuits, for which atoms are trapped near microand nano-scopic dielectric structures and “wired” together by photons propagating through the circuit elements. Single atoms and atomic ensembles can endow quantum functionality for otherwise linear optical circuits and thereby the capability to build quantum networks component by component.},

abstract={Optomechanical interactions in high-finesse cavities offer a new promising route for the ongoing experimental efforts to achieve and to control the quantum regime of massive mechanical systems using the available toolbox of quantum optics. For example, they allow to cool mechanical degrees of freedom of movable mirrors via radiation-pressure backaction, in principle even into their quantum ground state. Ground-state cooling will eventually require to realize the scheme in a cryogenic environment. We have taken this next step and realized stable operation of a high-finesse cavity inside a 4He cryostat . This allowed us to show radiation- pressure laser cooling of a micro-mechanical kHz resonator from a base temperature of 5 K to approximately 1.3 mK, which corresponds to a thermal occupation factor of = 32 plusmn 4 . Heating effects, e.g. due to absorption of photons in the micromirror, could not be observed. The cooling performance is only limited by the thermal coupling to the environment, which can be further reduced by improving the mechanical quality factor of the mechanical resonator and by further reducing the environmental temperature. The paper discusses the relevance of these results for the preparation and control of mechanical quantum states.},

abstract={Quantum networks scale the advantages of quantum communication protocols to more than just two distant users. Here we present a fully connected quantum network architecture in which a single entangled photon source distributes quantum states to a multitude of users [1]. Our network architecture thus minimizes the resources required of each user without sacrificing security or functionality. As no adaptations of the source are required to add users, the network can readily be scaled to a large number of clients, whereby no trust in the provider of the quantum source is required. Unlike previous attempts at multi-user networks, which have been based on active components, and thus limited to some duty cycle, our implementation is fully passive and thus provides the potential for unprecedented quantum communication speeds. We experimentally demonstrate the feasibility of our approach using a single source of bi-partite polarization entanglement which is multiplexed into 12 wavelength channels to distribute 6 states between 4 users in a fully connected graph using only 1 fiber and polarization analysis module per user.},

abstract={Quantum technology is a fundamentally new way of harnessing Nature and it has potential for a truly revolutionary innovation and promise the next generation of products with exciting and astounding properties that will affect our lives profoundly. They will have a great influence in defence, aerospace, energy and telecommunications sectors. If this process is to continue in the future, new, quantum technology must replace or supplement what we have now. In particular, Quantum Information Technology can support entirely new modes of information processing based on so called quantum bits or qubits. Its eventual impact may be as great as or greater than that of its classical predecessor. There is almost daily progress in developing promising technologies for realizing quantum information processing with various advantages over its classical counterpart. Logic gates and wires are becoming smaller, and soon they will be made out of only a handful of atoms. Photons are unsurpassed as qubits in terms of decoherence times, mobility, and achievability of high-fidelity single-qubit operations. Thus far, entanglement experiments in optics have been very clean, and an optical quantum processor would obviously have an advantage in connecting to a quantum “network” (no need to convert between stationary and flying qubits). All-optical quantum computing became feasible when, in 2001, a breakthrough known as the KLM (Knill-Laflamme-Milburn) scheme showed that scalable quantum computing is possible using only single-photon sources, detectors, and linear optical circuits. This scheme relies on quantum interference with auxiliary photons at a beam splitter and single-photon detection to induce not-deterministic interactions. Nowadays, the limits of the original KLM linear optics quantum computing proposal, as well as the more recent cluster and graph-state approaches, in addition to various nonlinear optical approaches are explored, but several challenges must be overcome. The most important issues are the practical scalability of quantum circuits, the ability to perform quantum logic gates with error rates below the fault-tolerant threshold and their incorporation into large-scale quantum circuits with realistic physical resources and single-photon detectors packed on an optical chip. Optical integrated circuits offer great potential for realizing previously unfeasible large-scale quantum circuits. However, this architecture suffers not only of the overhead of multiple sources, detectors and ancillary qubits, but it needs to maintain the complete coherence between single photons in which qubits are encoded. The idea to reduce the overhead due to multiple single photon sources with very high degree of reciprocal coherence exploits the possibility to encode the whole state space in a complex optical circuit based on Multiple Rail (MR) Architecture: a particular state in input is encoded in the quantum superposition of a coherent light beam trough the different waveguides, so that it is possible to reproduce the mathematical and physical aspects of quantum entanglement in classical beams of light. Multiple Rail Architecture provides the realization of so called Classical or, better, Intra-System Entanglement. In practics a reconfigurable optical matrix of interconnected MachZehnder provides the representation of the complex Hilbert-Schmidt space where the quantum operation lives. This integrated system on chip can be both Photonics and/or Plasmonics. By exploiting this idea we are able to obtain all the universal quantum gates as SWAP, CNOT, CPHASE, TOFFOLI for two qubits and for multiqubits cases. The most important goal is the possibility to perform deterministic Bell measurements: in usual optical schemes the probability of success of Bell measurements is ½, while the novel architecture provides the possibility to discriminate all Bell states, so that the teleportation can become completely deterministic.},

abstract={Quantum information science has shown that harnessing quantum mechanical effects can dramatically improve performance for certain tasks in communication, computation and measurement. Already a number of photonic quantum circuits have been realized for quantum metrology, lithography and quantum logic gates. However, these demonstrations have relied on large-scale (bulk) optical elements bolted to large optical tables, thereby making them inherently unscalable and confining them to the research laboratory. This paper reports on the implementation of quantum optic integrated circuits, which not only dramatically reduces the footprint of quantum circuits, but allows unprecedented stability and control of the optical path length; this reveals the possibility for realizing previously unfeasible large scale quantum circuits. Results from femtosecond laser directly-written quantum circuits are also discussed. A large range of chip-scale "photonic building blocks" have been realized using this so-called direct-write technique and they include multimode optical interconnects, directional couplers and interferometers. The directly written quantum circuits exhibited high 2 and 3-photon Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) interference visibilities of 95.8% plusmn 0.5 and 84% plusmn 3% respectively.},

abstract={Summary form only given. Quantum network consisting of separate nodes processing information and linked by quantum channels is a promising and widely investigated general architecture for scalable and distributed quantum computing [1]. The most feasible proposals for realisation of such a network involve matter-based nodes (e.g. trapped atoms or ions or solid-state systems) communicating by photons [2]. This approach combines advantages of long-living and precisely manipulated systems for nodes with fast and convenient for long distance information transfer ones. Implementation of such a scheme opens up a lot of research challenges where establishing a reliable channel for quantum state transfer between two nodes by photons is essential, once the nodes are operating. It would by particularly convenient to have a standard channel that can different systems be talking to and the telecom band photons are good candidates for that because of well-established optical fiber infrastructure. In our work we implement a single photon frequency conversion to telecom band so that quantum systems with different emitting frequencies could be used in such a network. This approach also permits to minimize the losses and increase distances to 10s-kilometre range by exploiting the lowest attenuation band in fibers. The work is aimed in particular on developing device capable of converting photons produced by P3/2-D5/2 transition in 40Ca+ ion that corresponds to 854.2 nm wavelength as a promising candidate for the network nod.},

abstract={The implementation of quantum memory, i.e. a quantum interface between light and matter, is central to advanced applications of quantum information processing and communication [1]. Notably, quantum memories are key ingredients in quantum repeaters [2], which promise extending quantum communication beyond its current distance limit. After a brief review of the working principle of a quantum repeater and the state-of-the-art of experimental investigations into quantum memory, we will present the reversible transfer of photon-photon entanglement into entanglement between a photon and an excitation in a thulium-doped lithium-niobate waveguide cooled to 3K. Our finding constitutes an important step towards quantum repeaters and fully quantum-enabled networks.},

abstract={In this contribution, a novel concept for on-chip quantum optics and fully integrated quantum light sources is presented. The concept combines so far independent routes in the emerging field of cQED in solid state within an integrated nanophotonics device concept with unprecedented features. The proposed concept utilizes the fact that micropillar cavities allow for the localization of vertically emitting modes and laterally emitting whispering gallery modes (WGMs). This approach takes advantage of this unique opportunity provided by the micropillar geometry and comprises an electrically pumped WGM micropillar acting as in-plane laser source and radially displaced QD-micropillars which are optically pumped by the integrated microlaser. This specific configuration allows for the first time on-chip quantum optics in the cQED regime using an integrated coherent light source.},

abstract={Summary form only given. Quantum computing technology is at a crossroads. The technological route we choose must scale without limit. For quantum optics to play a part, optical loss, miniaturisation, and manufacturability must be simultaneously addressed. In quantum optics, a loss of a single photon is a loss of irreplaceable quantum information. Macroscale optics offers exceptionally low loss, and high performance, but has no hope to scale to thousands or millions of modes. Microscale optics, and silicon photonics in particular, offer exceptional miniaturisation and large-scale manufacturability, but pay a high price in loss [1]. We propose -and realise -a new platform for quantum optics: we retain the scale and manufacturability of silicon photonics, but extirpate its loss, both linear and nonlinear. We shift silicon quantum photonics to the short-wave infrared (SWYR), centred on 2.1 microns wavelength, on the optical end of the mid-infrared spectrum [2]. The minimum requirements for any quantum optical platform are: to source quantum-correlated light, and to demonstrate high-quality quantum interference. Here, we do both: we engineer an on-chip photon-pair source, and interfere the light from two such sources in a time-reversed Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) measurement [3]. In so doing, we show the first photon-pair source with all fields in the mid-infrared, and the first quantum interference between mid-infrared photons. We coherently pump both on-chip sources and thermally vary the on-chip phase, (j) to perform a time-reversed HOM interference measurement [3] with an accidental-subtracted visibility of V = 99.1 ± 0.9%.},

abstract={Quantum cryptography or more specifically quantum key distribution (QKD) is the most advanced quantum information protocol. We present here an entanglement-based QKD system designed to work at 1550 nm for optimal distribution in optical fibers using the BBM92 protocol. Our QKD system is realised as a compact device. The start-up and alignment is fully automated and stabilisation routines guarantee a hands-off and long-term operation. We show a reliable and stable key generation during a two-week demonstration over a 16km fiber. The results show the maturity reached in two-photon entanglement systems by automatically correcting for environmental changes. The high purity of the shared entangled state makes applications such as QKD possible and hopefully also stimulates the application of other quantum communication protocols in optical fibers.},

abstract={Summary form only given. Bose Einstein condensates (BEC) opened the way for realization of atomic ensembles with Heisenberg limited uncertainty. In microgravity extremely dilute samples of BEC can be obtained and observed after a free evolution on timescales of seconds. Applications range from atom optics to matter wave interferometry. This has led us to realize a BEC of 10000 87Rb atoms in microgravity. The experimental results (to be published) establish the fact, that in a microgravity environment ultra-large condensates (Icircosl.5 mm) after a free evolution of 1 second can be observed. In particular, microgravity provides mass independent confining potential which is very important for the research on a mixture of quantum gases. We aim to realize a new setup for multispecies experiments, which can be used in catapult mode doubling the time for microgravity to 9 seconds. The experiment is planned to use 87Rb and 40K as degenerate Bose and Fermi gases respectively and can be used to carry out experiments on interferometry, Bose-Fermi mixtures and tests of the weak equivalence principle in quantum domain. Up to date progress and future prospects of this ambitious and technically challenging project will be presented.},

This approach has fundamental advantages, as it allows for the individual manipulation of the atomic qubit and the implementation of a heralding scheme based on quantum non-demolition (QND) measurements of the atomic state.},

pages={1-1},
abstract={Summary form only given. Quantum Phase Estimation (PE) is a fundamental building block in the framework of Quantum Computing. Accurate estimation of the true eigenphase f0 of a known eigenstate |f> is fundamental for the implementation of many promising quantum algorithms. The interest in PE is also due to the modest quantum hardware requirements of the Iterative Phase Estimation Algorithm (IPEA) implementation [1], successfully implemented on small-scale devices [2]. However, IPEA makes hard decisions at each step of the algorithm, relying on majority voting schemes for its robustness against noise. It has been observed how non-error-corrected machines may enter a regime where error-rates for IPEA diverge quickly, making this approach impractical [3]. New Bayesian approaches, such as the Rejection Filtering Phase Estimation (RFPE), have been recently proposed to overcome these limitations [4]. Here, we report the implementation of RFPE in a photonic device embedding state-of-art integrated elements. Spontaneous Four Wave Mixing sources generate photon pairs. State preparation and evolution are accomplished via integrated Mach-Zehnder interferometers and thermo-optical phase shifters operating in the hundreds of kHz regime. Fast reconfigurability is key for RFPE, as the algorithm adaptively chooses the parameters for each experiment. Arbitrary CU(2) controlled operations are made possible by an entanglement-based scheme, integrated on this chip for the first time.},
