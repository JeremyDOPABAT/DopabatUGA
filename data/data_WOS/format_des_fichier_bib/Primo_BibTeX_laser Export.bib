abstract = {The quantum efficiency of an electroluminescent intersubband emitter based on InAs/AlSb has been measured as a function of the magnetic field up to 20T. Two series of oscillations periodic in 1/B are observed, corresponding to the elastic and inelastic scattering of electrons of the upper state of the radiative transitions. Experimental results are accurately reproduced by a calculation of the excited state lifetime as a function of the applied magnetic field. The interpretation of these data gives an exact measure of the relative weight of the scattering mechanisms and allows the extraction of material parameters such as the energy dependent electron effective mass and the optical phonon energy.},

volume = {93},
year = {2016},
abstract = {One of the key challenges in developing quantum networks is to generate single photons with high brightness, purity, and long temporal coherence. Semiconductor quantum dots potentially satisfy these requirements; however, due to imperfections in the surrounding material, the coherence generally degrades with increasing excitation power yielding a broader emission spectrum. Here we overcome this power-broadening regime and demonstrate an enhanced coherence at exciton saturation where the detected count rates are highest. We detect single-photon count rates of 460 000 counts per second under pulsed laser excitation while maintaining a single-photon purity greater than 99%. Importantly, the enhanced coherence is attained with quantum dots in ultraclean wurtzite InP nanowires, where the surrounding charge traps are filled by exciting above the wurtzite InP nanowire band gap. By raising the excitation intensity, the number of possible charge configurations in the quantum dot environment is reduced, resulting in a narrower emission spectrum. Via Monte Carlo simulations we explain the observed narrowing of the emission spectrum with increasing power. Cooling down the sample to 300 mK, we further enhance the single-photon coherence twofold as compared to operation at 4.5 K, resulting in a homogeneous coherence time, T 2 , of 1.2 ns, and two-photon interference visibility as high as 83% under strong temporal postselection (∼5% without temporal postselection).},

abstract = {The spin dynamics of a single Mn atom in a laser driven CdTe quantum dot is addressed theoretically. Recent experimental results [ Gall et al. Phys. Rev. Lett. 102 127402 (2009); Goryca et al. Phys. Rev. Lett. 103 087401 (2009) Gall et al. Phys. Rev. B 81 245315 (2010)] show that it is possible to induce Mn spin polarization by means of circularly polarized optical pumping. Pumping is made possible by the faster Mn spin relaxation in the presence of the exciton. Here we discuss different Mn spin-relaxation mechanisms: first, Mn-phonon coupling, which is enhanced in the presence of the exciton; second, phonon induced hole spin relaxation combined with carrier-Mn spin-flip coupling and photon emission results in Mn spin relaxation. We model the Mn spin dynamics under the influence of a pumping laser that injects excitons into the dot, taking into account exciton-Mn exchange and phonon induced spin relaxation of both Mn and holes. Our simulations account for the optically induced Mn spin pumping.},

abstract = {We study the complex electronic band structure of low In content InGaAs/GaP quantum dots. A supercell extended-basis tight-binding model is used to simulate the electronic and the optical properties of a pure GaAs/GaP quantum dot modeled at the atomic level. Transitions between hole states confined into the dots and several XZ-like electronic states confined by the strain field in the GaP barrier are found to play the main role on the optical properties. Especially, the calculated radiative lifetime for such indirect transitions is in good agreement with the photoluminescence decay time measured in time-resolved photoluminescence in the µs range. Photoluminescence experiments under hydrostatic pressure are also presented. The redshift of the photoluminescence spectrum with pressure is also in good agreement with the nature of the electronic confined states simulated with the tight-binding model.},

volume = {102},
year = {2020},
abstract = {We demonstrate here electrical control of the sign of the circularly polarized emission from the negatively charged trion, going from co-to contrapolarized with respect to the circular polarization of the laser, using a GaAs/AlAs quantum dot (QD) embedded in a field effect structure. The voltage range over which the trion is negatively (contra) circularly polarized is shown to be dependent on the laser excitation energy within the P-shell resonance. The negative polarization never exceeds ∼ − 15%, in stark contrast to measurements on InAs/GaAs QDs reported by M. E. Ware et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 95, 177403 (2005).] in which a negative polarization reaching −95% was observed. This result is shown to be a consequence of the low-symmetry confinement potential of these GaAs/AlAs QD, which are fabricated by partial infilling of asymmetric droplet-etched nanoholes. This low QD symmetry also leads to optical activity of the dark spin configuration of the triplet state, which we measure experimentally by photoluminescence excitation spectroscopy. A simple, semiquantitative model explaining both the optical activity of the dark spin configuration and the maximum degree of negative polarization is presented.},

volume = {81},
year = {2010},
abstract = {We have investigated the spin preparation efficiency by optical pumping of individual Mn atoms embedded in CdTe/ZnTe quantum dots. Monitoring the time dependence of the intensity of the fluorescence during the resonant optical pumping process in individual quantum dots allows to directly probe the dynamics of the initialization of the Mn spin. This technique presents the convenience of including preparation and readout of the Mn spin in the same step. Our measurements demonstrate that Mn spin initialization, at zero magnetic field, can reach an efficiency of 75% and occurs in the tens of nanoseconds range when a laser resonantly drives at saturation one of the quantum-dot transition. We observe that the efficiency of optical pumping changes from dot-to-dot and is affected by a magnetic field of a few tens of millitesla applied in Voigt or Faraday configuration. This is attributed to the local strain distribution at the Mn location which predominantly determines the dynamics of the Mn spin under weak magnetic field. The spectral distribution of the spin-flip-scattered photons from quantum dots presenting a weak optical pumping efficiency reveals a significant spin relaxation for the exciton split in the exchange field of the Mn spin.},

year = {2015},
abstract = {We present perturbative analytical results of the Landau level quasienergy spectrum, autocorrelation function, and out-of-plane pseudospin polarization for a single graphene sheet subject to intense circularly polarized Terahertz radiation. For the quasienergy spectrum, we find a striking nontrivial level-dependent dynamically induced gap structure. This photoinduced modulation of the energy band structure gives rise to shifts of the revival times in the autocorrelation function and it also leads to modulation of the oscillations in the dynamical evolution of the out-of-plane pseudospin polarization, which measures the angular momentum transfer between light and graphene electrons. For a coherent state, chosen as an initial pseudospin configuration, the dynamics induces additional quantum revivals of the wave function that manifest as shifts of the maxima and minima of the autocorrelation function, with additional partial revivals and beating patterns. These additional maxima and beating patterns stem from the effective dynamical coupling of the static eigenstates. We discuss the possible experimental detection schemes of our theoretical results and their relevance in new practical implementation of radiation fields in graphene physics.},

volume = {87},
year = {2013},
abstract = {We investigate experimentally and theoretically the resonant emission of single InAs/GaAs quantum dots in a planar microcavity. Due to the presence of at least one residual charge in the quantum dots, the resonant excitation of the neutral exciton is blocked. The influence of the residual doping on the initial quantum dots charge state is analyzed, and the resonant emission quenching is interpreted as a Coulomb blockade effect. The use of an additional non-resonant laser in a specific low power regime leads to the carrier draining in quantum dots and allows an efficient optical gating of the exciton resonant emission. A detailed population evolution model, developed to describe the carrier draining and the optical gate effect, perfectly fits the experimental results in the steady state and dynamical regimes of the optical gate with a single set of parameters. We deduce that ultra-slow Auger- and phonon-assisted capture processes govern the carrier draining in quantum dots with relaxation times in the 1 - 100 microsecond range. We conclude that the optical gate acts as a very sensitive probe of the quantum dots population relaxation in an unprecedented slow-capture regime.},

abstract = {We present a quantum description of a planar microcavity photon mode strongly coupled to a semiconductor intersubband transition in presence of a two-dimensional electron gas. We show that, in this kind of system, the vacuum Rabi frequency $\Omega_R$ can be a significant fraction of the intersubband transition frequency $\omega_{12}$. This regime of ultra-strong light-matter coupling is enhanced for long wavelength transitions, because for a given doping density, effective mass and number of quantum wells, the ratio $\Omega_R/\omega_{12}$ increases as the square root of the intersubband emission wavelength. We characterize the quantum properties of the ground state (a two-mode squeezed vacuum), which can be tuned {\it in-situ} by changing the value of $\Omega_R$, e.g., through an electrostatic gate. We finally point out how the tunability of the polariton quantum vacuum can be exploited to generate correlated photon pairs out of the vacuum via quantum electrodynamics phenomena reminiscent of the dynamic Casimir effect.},
