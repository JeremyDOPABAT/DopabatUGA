note = {{These notes provide a pedagogical introduction to the theoretical study of vacuum polarization effects in strong electromagnetic fields as provided by state-of-the-art high-intensity lasers. Quantum vacuum fluctuations give rise to effective couplings between electromagnetic fields, thereby supplementing Maxwell{\textquoteright}s linear theory of classical electrodynamics with nonlinearities. Resorting to a simplified laser pulse model allowing for explicit analytical insights, we demonstrate how to efficiently analyze all-optical signatures of these effective interactions in high-intensity laser experiments. Moreover, we highlight several key features relevant for the accurate planning and quantitative theoretical analysis of quantum vacuum nonlinearities in the collision of high-intensity laser pulses. ; Comment: 21 pages, 1 figure; Lectures given at the Helmholtz International Summer School (HISS) - Dubna International Advanced School of Theoretical Physics (DIAS-TH): "Quantum Field Theory at the Limits: from Strong Fields to Heavy Quarks", July-August 2019}},

note = {{Due to their intuitiveness, flexibility, and relative numerical efficiency, the macroscopic Maxwell{\textendash}Bloch (MB) equations are a widely used semiclassical and semi-phenomenological model to describe optical propagation and coherent light{\textendash}matter interaction in media consisting of discrete-level quantum systems. This review focuses on the application of this model to advanced optoelectronic devices, such as quantum cascade and quantum dot lasers. The Bloch equations are here treated as a density matrix model for driven quantum systems with two or multiple discrete energy levels, where dissipation is included by Lindblad terms. Furthermore, the 1D MB equations for semiconductor waveguide structures and optical fibers are rigorously derived. Special analytical solutions and suitable numerical methods are presented. Due to the importance of the MB equations in computational electrodynamics, an emphasis is placed on the comparison of different numerical schemes, both with and without the rotating wave approximation. The implementation of additional effects which can become relevant in semiconductor structures, such as spatial hole burning, inhomogeneous broadening, and local-field corrections, is discussed. Finally, links to microscopic models and suitable extensions of the Lindblad formalism are briefly addressed.}},

year = {2019},
note = {{Although classical and quantum heat engines work on entirely different fundamental principles, there is an underlying similarity. For instance, the form of efficiency at optimal performance may be similar for both types of engines. In this work, we study a three-level laser quantum heat engine operating at maximum ecological function (EF) which represents a compromise between the power output and the loss of power due to entropy production. We derive analytic expressions for efficiency under the assumptions of strong matter-field coupling and high bath temperatures. Upper and lower bounds on the efficiency exist in case of extreme asymmetric dissipation when the ratio of system-bath coupling constants at the hot and the cold contacts respectively approaches, zero or infinity. These bounds have been established previously for various classical models of Carnot-like engines. We conclude that while the engine produces at least 75\\% of the power output as compared with the maximum power conditions, the fractional loss of power is appreciably low in case of the engine operating at maximum EF, thus making this objective function relevant from an environmental point of view. ; Comment: 9 pages, 5 figures}},
