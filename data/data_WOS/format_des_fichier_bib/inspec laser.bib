note={Quantum technologies containing key GaN laser components will enable a new generation of high precision quantum sensors, optical atomic clocks and secure communication systems for many applications such as next generation navigation, gravity mapping and timing since the AlGaInN material system allows for laser diodes to be fabricated over a wide range of wavelengths from the u.v. to the visible. We report our latest results on a range of AlGaInN diode-lasers targeted to meet the linewidth, wavelength and power requirements suitable for optical clocks and cold-atom interferometry systems. This includes the [5s2S1/2-5p2P1/2] cooling transition in strontium+ ion optical clocks at 422 nm, the [5s21S0-5p1P1] cooling transition in neutral strontium clocks at 461 nm and the [5s2s1/2 - 6p2P3/2] transition in rubidium at 420 nm. Several approaches are taken to achieve the required linewidth, wavelength and power, including an extended cavity laser diode (ECLD) system and an on-chip grating, distributed feedback (DFB) GaN laser diode.},

note={The quantum Ettingshausen effect in a parabolic quantum well subjected to a constant electric field, magnetic field in the presence of laser radiation is studied by using the quantum kinetic equation method. The analytic expressions for conductivity tensors and dynamic tensors as well as the Ettingshausen coecient (EC) are obtained in the case of the electron-confined optical phonon (COP) scattering. The EC depends on specific quantities for external field (such as magnetic field, amplitude and frequency of laser radiation), temperature of the system and quantum well length, especially quantum number m-characterizing the confinement of optical phonon (OP). When m is set to zero, we get the results corresponding to the case of unconfined OP. The analytic results are numerically evaluated and graphed for GaAs/AlGaAs parabolic quantum well. When examining the eect of temperature, the EC has greater values due to the COP. Meanwhile, when quantum well length and amplitude of the laser radiation (LR) increase, the EC has greater values without the confinement of OP. Because of the approach of system to bulk semiconductor structure when the quantum well length approaches micrometer-size, the EC reaches constant. The quantum number m leads to the change of resonance peaks position within the change of the magnetic field and the frequency of LR. In addition, the EC exerts non-linear dependence on the amplitude the LR. All results indicated that the COP aects not only qualitatively but also the transformation rules of the EC. It provides new insights and contributes to the orientation of research into quantum eects in low-dimensional semiconductor systems (LDS).},

note={Four-wave-mixing-based quantum cascade laser frequency combs (QCL-FC) are a powerful photonic tool, driving a recent revolution in major molecular fingerprint regions, i.e. mid- and far-infrared domains. Their compact and frequency-agile design, together with their high optical power and spectral purity, promise to deliver an all-in-one source for the most challenging spectroscopic applications. Here, we demonstrate a metrological-grade hybrid dual comb spectrometer, combining the advantages of a THz QCL-FC with the accuracy and absolute frequency referencing provided by a free-standing, optically-rectified THz frequency comb. A proof-of-principle application to methanol molecular transitions is presented. The multi-heterodyne molecular spectra retrieved provide state-of-the-art results in line-center determination, achieving the same precision as currently available molecular databases. The devised setup provides a solid platform for a new generation of THz spectrometers, paving the way to more refined and sophisticated systems exploiting full phase control of QCL-FCs, or Doppler-free spectroscopic schemes.

For short cavity lengths and low terahertz losses in the substrate, we find that implementation of the Cerenkov emission scheme in terahertz difference frequency generation quantum cascade lasers improves the optical external efficiency dramatically.

note={Recently, the field of optical frequency combs experienced a major development of new sources. They are generally much smaller in size (on the scale of millimetres) and can extend frequency comb emission to other spectral regions, in particular towards the mid- and far-infrared regions. Unlike classical pulsed frequency combs, their mode-locking mechanism relies on four-wave-mixing nonlinear processes, yielding a non-trivial phase relation among the modes and an uncommon emission time profile. Here, by combining dual-comb multi-heterodyne detection with Fourier-transform analysis, we show how to simultaneously acquire and monitor over a wide range of timescales the phase pattern of a generic (unknown) frequency comb. The technique is applied to characterize both a mid-infrared and a terahertz quantum cascade laser frequency comb, conclusively proving the high degree of coherence and the remarkable long-term stability of these sources. Moreover, the technique allows also the reconstruction of the electric field, intensity profile and instantaneous frequency of the emission.},

note={This work uses insitu narrowband quantum cascade laser (QCL) absorption spectroscopy to study the effect of N2 on the time evolution of gas temperature, rotational temperature and the vibrational temperatures of CO2 and CO in a pulsed glow discharge. Three colinear QCLs are used to scan three regions of about 1 cm-1 between 2179.20 and 2253.51 cm-1, including transitions up to the asymmetric stretch level v3 = 6, as well as (vCO) -> (vCO + 1) CO transitions up to vCO = 1. A fitting routine is used to extract temperatures from the measured absorption spectra. The time resolved measurements are performed in CO2, admixed with up to 90{\%} N2, with the plasma operated with a 5-10 ms on-off cycle, a discharge current of 50 mA and a pressure of around 6.7 mbar. The time evolution of the gas temperature has been measured and agrees well with the time evolution of the rotational temperature. The asymmetric stretch vibrational temperature T3 of CO2 reaches a maximum of 1060 K at 0.7 ms for pure CO2, while T3 goes up to 2250 K for a N2 content of 90{\%} and stays constant until the plasma is switched off. Both T3 and the vibrational temperature of CO TCO show a clear non-equilibrium with respect to the rotational temperature Trot. Both do not equilibrate with the rotational temperature Trot between consecutive plasma cycles for a N2 content above 70{\%}, although T3 and TCO always equilibrate with each other in the afterglow. The symmetric stretch and bending mode temperature T12 is elevated more with respect to the rotational temperature for increasing N2 content, while the maximum of the rotational temperature decreases for increasing N2 admixtures, which might be attributed to the energy stored in the vibrational modes of N2, CO2 and CO. Additionally, an indication of an increase in the total pressure during the plasma on-time due to heating and a subsequent decrease in the afterglow due to cooling was found for a pure CO2 plasma.},

note={Diamond has attracted great interest as a quantum technology platform thanks to its optically active nitrogen vacancy center (NV). The NV's ground state spin can be read out optically exhibiting long spin coherence times of about 1 ms even at ambient temperatures. In addition, the energy levels of the NV are sensitive to external fields. These properties make NVs attractive as a scalable platform for efficient nanoscale resolution sensing based on electron spins and for quantum information systems. Diamond photonics enhances optical interaction with NVs, beneficial for both quantum sensing and information. Diamond is also compelling for microfluidic applications due to its outstanding biocompatibility, with sensing functionality provided by NVs. However, it remains a significant challenge to fabricate photonics, NVs and microfluidics in diamond. In this Report, an overview is provided of ion irradiation and femtosecond laser writing, two promising fabrication methods for diamond based quantum technological devices. The unique capabilities of both techniques are described, and the most important fabrication results of color center, optical waveguide and microfluidics in diamond are reported, with an emphasis on integrated devices aiming towards high performance quantum sensors and quantum information systems of tomorrow.

note={Real-time multiple trace gas monitoring instrument, based on photoacoustic spectroscopy has an important application in space capsule.

The long current pulse edge makes QCL heat fast and widen its linewidth. On the other hand, low repetition frequency rate does not meet the requirements of gas measurement. In this work, we improve the capacitor charge-discharge pulse circuit and design a new pulse driver. The new pulse driver has short current pulse edge and high repetition frequency. Experimental results show that the driver outputs current with an amplitude greater than 1.7 amperes under a 12V DC power source and an equivalent resistor 2.73 omega; in addition, increase/decrease time is no more than 20 nanoseconds, a pulse width can be randomly adjusted, a smallest pulse width can be as low as 20 nanosecond, and a largest repetition frequency exceeds 1 MHz.},

note={External cavity lasers show a variety of uses, for which quantum well semiconductor lasers are already commercially used. Due to the atom-like discrete energy levels, quantum dots exhibit various properties resulting from the three-dimensional confinement of carriers, like high stability against temperature variation, large gain bandwidth, and low-threshold lasing operation. Quantum dots seem to be ideal to address the challenges in the further development of various semiconductor applications, such as high-resolution spectroscopy or broadband optical communication networks, for which a range of spectral and temporal characteristics is required, for instance a narrow spectral linewidth, low intensity noise or wide wavelength tunability. In this view, external cavity quantum dot gain chips can be envisoned to replace the current quantum well technology. Using a semi-analytical rate equation model, we successfully analyze both dynamical and noise properties of an external cavity laser made with quantum dot gain medium, operating under strong optical feedback. This paper investigates the turn-on delay, the relative intensity noise, and the frequency noise and compares them to the case without optical feedback. These numerical investigations of an external cavity quantum dot gain chip provide meaningful building blocks for future fabrication research or for developing high performance device such as wavelength-selective components.},

note={The frequency comb which is characterized by equally-spaced frequency lines with high mode coherence has received much attention since its first demonstration in near-infrared and optical frequency range. In the terahertz frequency range, the electrically-pumped terahertz quantum cascade laser (THz QCL) based on semiconductors is an ideal candidate for achieving frequency comb operation in a frequency range between 1 THz and 5 THz. The group velocity dispersion (GVD) is a key factor for the frequency comb. A higher GVD can pull the frequencies from their equidistant values and limit the comb bandwidth. Therefore the laser dispersion needs to be compensated for in order to make the total GVD sufficiently low and flat, such as using a Gires-Tournois interferometer (GTI) or the double chirped mirror (DCM). However, a successful design still depends on the knowledge of the total GVD in the laser. In this paper, we show how to calculate the GVD in metal-metal waveguide THz QCLs by taking into account the dispersions from the GaAs material, the waveguide, and the laser gain, which conduces to the understanding of the frequency comb behavior. The waveguide loss is modelled by the finite element method. The loss due to intersubband absorption is calculated by Fermi's gold rule. All the losses, i.e., waveguide loss, mirror loss, and intersubband absorption loss, are summed up to calculate the clamped gain. The material loss can be calculated by using the reststrahlen band model. Because of these losses and gain, the refractive index needs to be replaced by a complex refractive index. The real part of the complex refractive index is the refractive index, which can be calculated from the Kramers-Kronig relationship that connects the loss or gain with the refractive index. Then the GVD introduced by the material loss, waveguide loss, and clamped gain can be finally calculated. The results show that the total GVD of THz QCL is approximately -8 x 105-8 x 105 fs2/mm which is strongly determined by the clamped gain. Finally, the developed numerical model is employed to study the dispersion compensation effect of a GTI mirror which is coupled into a QCL gain cavity. The design of the THz QCL based on GTI structure is more flexible and feasible than that of the DCM. The result shows that by carefully designing the geometry of GTI, the dispersion of a THz QCL can be compensated for, thus achieving the broadband terahertz frequency combs.},

note={We report a detailed experimental demonstration of the Goos-Hanchen (GH) shift of light in total internal reflection condition for a Gaussian mode laser beam of 633 nm passing through an air-glass interface. The quantum weak measurement (QWM) technique has been exploited as a weak value amplification scheme to observe the amplified optical GH shift. The amplification of the GH shift depends on the angular deviation from the exact orthogonal position required for weak measurement. We have subsequently investigated the profiles of the beam pattern and their horizontal and vertical shifts in detail. We also show that the beam shift values obtained experimentally agree well with the theoretical results for a specific choice of angle of deviation from the orthogonal condition of weak measurement. Our results clearly demonstrate the advantages of the QWM technique for amplifying and detecting tiny optical beam shift effects and may provide important applications in precision metrology.},

note={Hyperbranched polyethylenimine coated zinc selenide (PEI-ZnSe) quantum dots were synthesized by femtosecond laser ablation in microfluidics. The PEI-ZnSe aqueous dispersions showed a strong green fluorescence at 500 nm. Based on Density functional theory, the defect energy level characteristics of different point defects in the Se-rich ZnSe quantum dots were studied. The results show that the shallow acceptor levels close to HOMO will be introduced into the bandgap by Se interstitial point defects, and the deep acceptor level close to LUMO will be introducted into the badgap by Se antisites point defect. According to the calculation results of defect energy levels, the energy level transition mechanism of quantum dot absorption and fluorescence emission were analyzed, and the types and quantities of defects existing in the quantum dots are discussed. The results show that the prepared PEI-ZnSe organic composite quantum dots have a large amount of SeZn and Sei defects, and the green fluorescence near 500 nm is the defect level luminescence (SeZn -> Sei).},

note={A passively fast polarization switching erbium-doped fibre laser using quantum dot tungsten disulfide (QDWS2) as a saturable absorber (SA) has been proposed. It could generate polarization domain walls (PDWs). The PDWs` spectrum can be divided into two separated spectra, which are orthogonally polarized. In detail, the horizontal polarization component wavelength is centred at 1561.1 nm with a repetition rate of 19.347 MHz, a pulse duration of 30 ns, and a signal-to-noise ratio of 73.2 dB at the maximum pump power. The vertical polarization component wavelength is centred at 1561.5 nm, with a pulse duration of 20.4 ns. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a polarization domain wall generated by a QDWS2-SA. These results provide a platform to investigate anticorrelated polarization dynamics in quasi-isotropic fibre lasers. Moreover, their robustness and attractive properties could find potential applications in optical communications, data storage, and fibre laser devices.},

note={Miniaturized frequency comb sources across hard-to-access spectral regions, i.e. mid- and far-infrared, have long been sought. Four-wave-mixing based Quantum Cascade Laser combs (QCL-combs) are ideal candidates, in this respect, due to the unique possibility to tailor their spectral emission by proper nanoscale design of the quantum wells. We demonstrate full-phase-stabilization of a QCL-comb against the primary frequency standard, proving independent and simultaneous control of the two comb degrees of freedom (modes spacing and frequency offset) at a metrological level. Each emitted mode exhibits a sub-Hz relative frequency stability, while a correlation analysis on the modal phases confirms the high degree of coherence in the device emission, over different power-cycles and over different days. The achievement of fully controlled, phase-stabilized QCL-comb emitters proves that this technology is mature for metrological-grade uses, as well as for an increasing number of scientific and technological applications.},

note={Gas spectroscopy is a tool that can be used in a variety of applications. One example is in the medical field, where it can diagnose patients by detecting biomarkers in breath, and another is in the security field, where it can safely alert personnel about ambient concentrations of dangerous gas. In this paper, we document the design and construction of a system compact enough to be easily deployable in defense, healthcare, and chemical safety environments. Current gas sensing systems use basic quantum cascade lasers (QCLs) or distributed feedback quantum cascade lasers (DFB QCLs) with large benchtop signal recovery systems to determine gas concentrations. There are significant issues with these setups, namely the lack of laser tunability and the lack of practicality outside of a very clean lab setting. QCLs are advantageous for gas sensing purposes because they are the most efficient lasers at the mid infrared region (MIR). This is necessary since gases tend to have stronger absorption lines in the MIR range than in the near-infrared (NIR) region. To incorporate the efficiency of a QCL with wide tuning capabilities in the MIR region, sampled grating distributed feedback (SGDFB) QCLs are the answer as they have produced systems that are widely tunable, which is advantageous for scanning a robust and complete absorption spectrum. The system employs a SGDFB QCL array emitter, a Type II InAsSb Superlattice detector receiver, a gas cell, and a cooling system.},

note={The unique optical properties of solution-processable colloidal semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) highlight their promising applications in the next generation of optoelectronic and biomedical technologies. In order to optimize these applications, the tunability of QDs' optical properties is always highly desired. Although the tuning during synthesis stages has been intensively investigated, the in situ alteration after device fabrication is still limited. Here we report the tuning of the optical properties of CdSeTe/ZnS QDs through an in situ manipulation of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between QDs and monolayer graphene oxide (GO). By increasing the acceptor's absorption ability of GO through laser irradiation, the efficiency of FRET between QDs and GO has been substantially improved from 29.7{\%} to 70.0{\%}. The corresponding energy transfer rate is enhanced by 5.5 times. These results can be well explored by a spectral overlap between the fluorescence emission of QDs and the absorption of original or reduced GO. Our scheme, with the features of in situ manipulation, high spatial resolution and wireless steering, enables the potential functionality of such hybrid structures in optoelectronic applications.},

We observed that changing laser power 1 Watt to become 1.7 Watt and time ablation 20 minutes to become 60 minutes will alterate the Photoluminescence (PL) curve peak of GQDs. In case of ablation power variation, PL data shows that the PL curve peak excited by 280 nm laser changed from 369.09 nm to 371.02 nm, and when it excited by 290 nm the PL curve peak slightly changed from 388.17 nm to 393.8 nm. The alteration of Photoluminescence peak is also observed in the variation of time ablation experiment, The PL curve peaks from GQDs time ablation variation samples excited by 280 nm were slightly changed from 376.81 nm to 373.59 nm, and when it excited by 290 nm laser, the PL curve peak is 391.55 nm then changed to 392.11. The change of PL peak on laser power or time ablation variation shows that both parameters will alter either the size, shape, or the edge-type of GQDs.},

These devices demonstrated drastic improvements in performance in the past several years and can produce broadband and narrow-linewidth single-mode terahertz emission with power output sufficient for spectroscopic applications. Recent efforts in the wavefunction engineering using an active region design based on a dual-upper-state concept led to a significant enhancement of the optical nonlinearity of the active region for efficient terahertz generation. Dual-upper-state terahertz quantum cascade laser sources exhibit the power of >0.3 mW. Here, we report low frequency generation from terahertz quantum cascade laser sources based on intra-cavity nonlinear frequency mixing. In order to achieve higher nonlinear susceptibility in low frequency region, we design a long wavelength dual-upper-state active region in which transition dipole moments are increased. A fabricated device with distributed feedback grating demonstrates a THz peak output power of 40 microW at room temperature, with multi-mode THz emission at a frequency of 1.4 THz. Besides, a device produces THz output power of >250 microW at 110 K, which is higher output power, compared to low- frequency THz-QCLs at liquid helium temperature.},

The QDs were fabricated by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) in Stranski-Krastanov mode at 480degreeC and then at the same temperature the pulsed laser was in situ introduced to modify the QDs with different energy. The dependence of morphology evolution on irradiation energy was carefully studied by AFM testing. The results show that laser excitation can enable both desorption and diffusion of In atoms which may induce strong modification on the InAs QDs. For irradiation of a moderate energy, the 3D dot-like InAs QD will transform into 2D oval-shaped island; Once the irradiation energy is high enough, the InAs QDs will be completely removed off from the surface. The involved mechanism is also discussed. Herein, we have proposed a new approach of fabricating QDs which is high-efficient, pollution-free, oxidation-free and defect-resistant and it is believed in the near future, it may find wide applications in both the fundamental physics research and emerging device manufacture.},

A thorough parametric analysis on the effect of three tuning parameters (viz. injection current, cavity length, absorber-to-device length ratio) on the optical power-injection current (L-I) and spectral characteristics, particularly wavelength tunability and bandwidth broadening, is performed. A total emission wavelength tunability of {\textasciitilde}20 nm is demonstrated in the mid-L-band ({\textasciitilde}1600 to {\textasciitilde}1620 nm) window and {\textasciitilde}2 times enhancement in the 3dB bandwidth.

Further investigation displayed a direct relation between the absorber length and the hysteresis loop width with a maximum value of {\textasciitilde}40 mA is demonstrated; a potential platform in fast optical switching and modulation applications. Finally, the two-sectioned structure is also proposed and investigated as a monolithic two-segment contact spectrum shaper to manipulate the lasing spectrum profiles to attain flat tops and effectively increase the spectrum 3dB bandwidth. As such, a maximum 3dB bandwidth was able to be pushed up to {\textasciitilde}20 nm from {\textasciitilde}7 nm by proper tuning of the current density distribution across the two segments of the device.},

note={In this work, nitrogen-doped graphene quantum dots (N-GQDs) were synthesized by pulsed laser ablation in liquid using Nd:YAG laser (532 nm). Graphite target was ablated in dimethylformamide, as solvent and nitrogen source, and the microstructure as well as optical properties of N-GQDs were studied. The N-GQDs structure consists of a graphitic core with oxygen and nitrogen functionalities and particle size about 3 nm, as demonstrated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The as-prepared N-GQDs structure was modified by solvothermal treatment at 65, 90 and 120 degreeC reducing the oxygen functional groups, adding nitrogen and restoring the pi-conjugated structure of N-GQD. The N-GQDs exhibit UV-Vis absorption spectrum with the characteristic pi-pi* and n - pi* electronic transitions of the GQDs with a large amount of oxygen and nitrogen functionalities. These N-GQDs exhibited a visible light photoluminescence centered at 486 nm upon an excitation of 410 nm and the photoluminescence intensity enhanced up to 4.05{\%} of quantum yield after solvothermal treatment. The N-GQDs dispersion was used for selective detection of ascorbic acid, through a signal-off and signal-on system. The results show the use of N-GQDs as a competent photoluminescence sensor for metal ions and ascorbic acid. [All rights reserved Elsevier].},

note={Quantum dot (QD) lasers are playing an important role in high-speed optical communications and high-temperature sensing applications due to stable operation at high temperature. We propose here performance analysis of QD laser fabricated using standard photolithography and wet etch process. An InAs-GaAs quantum dot laser is fabricated and characterized for 0.948 V operating potential developed across the device and light-current characteristics exhibiting threshold current density (Jth) of 56A/cm2 per QD layer in both pulse and CW mode of operation. The slope efficiency of - 0.182 mW/A is measured in pulse mode. The optical power ranges up to 63 mW in pulse mode and 45 mW in CW operation at 800 mA. An analysis has been carried to estimate the threshold at different temperature exploiting quasiFermi levels and distribution of current density over the QD layers and confinement layers.},

note={We introduce a combined molecular-dynamics and quantum-trajectories code to simulate the effects of near-resonant optical fields on state-vector evolution and particle motion in a collisional system. In contrast to collisionless systems, in which the quantum dynamics of multilevel, laser-driven particles with spontaneous emission can be described with the optical Bloch equations (OBEs), particle velocities in sufficiently collisional systems change on timescales comparable to those of the laser-induced, quantum-state dynamics. These transient velocity changes can cause the time-averaged velocity dependence of the quantum state to differ from the OBE solution. We use this multiscale code to describe laser cooling in a strontium ultracold neutral plasma. Important phenomena described by the simulation include suppression of electromagnetically induced transparencies through rapid velocity changing collisions and thermalization between cooled and uncooled directions for anisotropic laser cooling.},

note={A stable multiwavelength erbium-doped fiber laser has been proposed and experimentally demonstrated based on black phosphorus quantum dots (BPQDs) packaged by polytetrafluoroethylene. The laser mainly consists of a polytetrafluoroethylene packaging device of black phosphorus quantum dots (PTFEPD-BPQDs) and a Lyot filter. PTFEPD-BPQDs have the function of suppressing the mode competition and stabilizing the multiwavelength output. In the experiments, for the unpackaged BPQDs device, BPQDs will degrade and lose its function within 48 h, whereas for the PTFEPD-BPQDs, BPQDs can keep their function for more than 3 weeks. Fifteen stable multiwavelength lasing signals (MWLSs) with the wavelength space of 0.35 nm are achieved. A 10-min optically driven deposition is more conducive to the stable output of MWLSs. The wavelength offset and peak power fluctuation of the output spectrum at central wavelength are 0.1 nm and 0.9 dB, respectively.},

Although there many synthesis methods of BNQDs, most of them require complex or time-consuming procedures, which limits the application of BNQDs. Here, we present a facile synthesizing method of few-layer BNQDs, which is based on liquid-phase ultra-short laser pulse ablation and ultrasonic-assisted exfoliation methods. The fabricated BNQDs are systematically characterized by atomic force microscope, transmission electron microscope, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy. The products possess an average size of about 2.1 nm with few-layer thickness. Because of the abundant surface functional groups, the BNQDs show bright luminescence emission under UV light irradiation.},

note={In order to achieve electrically pumped plasmon nano lasers, several structures, materials and methods, have been proposed recently. However, there is still a long way to find out a reliable appropriate on-chip plasmon source for commercial plasmonic integrated circuits. In this paper, a new integrated nanocavity plasmon laser is proposed, analyzed and simulated for 1550 nm free-space wavelength. Due to its significant field confinement resulted by the metal strip structure and strong interaction of plasmonic modes with the germanium quantum wells this structure has a remarkable output performance. Purcell factor of this nanocavity is about 291. Using semi-classical rate equations in combination with finite difference time domain (FDTD) cavity mode analysis, the output performance measures are estimated and confirmed with respect to various physical models and simulation tools. Simulation results for this structure which has 0.073 microm2 area show a 2.8 microW output power with 10 microA injection current and about 4.16 mW output power with the threshold pump current of 27 mA, while maintaining its performance in a wide spectral bandwidth about 1.46 THz. It also can be electrically modulated by the pump current up to 5.7 GHz.},

note={In this paper, the multi-wavelength solution-processed quantum dot laser has been proposed by the superimposed quantum dots. To this end, the rate equation framework has been developed to model the simultaneous lasing in desired wavelengths by considering inhomogeneous broadening of energy level as a result of the size distribution of quantum dots and the homogeneous broadening due to the carries scattering inside quantum dots. Moreover, the solution process technology has been utilized in order to synthesize the quantum dots in various sizes according to the desired wavelengths. The simulation results show that simultaneous lasing has been realized by superimposition of two sizes of InGaAs quantum dots in a single cavity at two wavelengths of 1.31 microm and 1.55 microm which have special importance in telecommunication applications. Besides, the output power intensity at the desired wavelengths can be managed by controlling the density of quantum dots. [All rights reserved Elsevier].},

In addition to the inherent enhancements that are provided by injection locking, the system provides comparable high dual-mode peak power, side mode suppression ratio (SMSR) up to 30 dB, and large beat frequency tunability of {\textasciitilde}1.7 THz. As such, four different beat frequencies are demonstrated, namely 62.6- and 263-GHz MMW and 1.21- and 1.75-THz signals.

note={With the ongoing progress of optoelectronic components, laser-based measurement systems allow measurements of position as well as displacement, strain and velocity with unbeatable speed and low measurement uncertainty. The performance limit is often studied for a single measurement setup, but a fundamental comparison of different measurement principles with respect to the ultimate limit due to quantum shot noise is rare. For this purpose, the Crame'r-Rao bound is described as a universal information theoretic tool to calculate the minimal achievable measurement uncertainty for different measurement techniques, and a review of the respective lower bounds for laser-based measurements of position, displacement, strain and velocity at particles and surfaces is presented. As a result, the calculated Crame'r-Rao bounds of different measurement principles have similar forms for each measurand including an indirect proportionality with respect to the number of photons and, in case of the position measurement for instance, the wave number squared. Furthermore, an uncertainty principle between the position uncertainty and the wave vector uncertainty was identified, i.e., the measurement uncertainty is minimized by maximizing the wave vector uncertainty. Additionally, physically complementary measurement approaches such as interferometry and time-of-flight positions measurements as well as time-of-flight and Doppler particle velocity measurements are shown to attain the same fundamental limit. Since most of the laser-based measurements perform similar with respect to the quantum shot noise, the realized measurement systems behave differently only due to the available optoelectronic components for the concrete measurement task.},

Methanol spectra are obtained using two laser modes at 3.362 THz and 3.428 THz simultaneously, with more than 8 absorption peaks resolved over a 17-GHz bandwidth, which provide minimum detectable absorption coefficients of 2.7x10-4 cm-1 and 4.9x10-4 cm-1, respectively. In contrast to all previous self-mixing spectroscopy, our multimode technique expands the sensing bandwidth significantly. This broadband spectroscopy technique can potentially be used for the identification and analysis of chemical, biological radiological and nuclear (CBRN) agents and explosives.},
