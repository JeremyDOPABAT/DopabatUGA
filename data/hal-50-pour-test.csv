Piezoelectric ceramics exhibit conductive and dielectric losses. However\, in most models used in energy harvesting\, these losses are disregarded\, as they appear to be relatively small in manufacturer datasheets. In this paper\, after briefly introducing the origins of those losses\, we experimentally prove that they are strongly dependent on the electric field in the material. This means that the datasheets data\, obtained under low electric field characterizations\, are not representative of the actual material losses under real-world vibrations. Thereafter\, we prove that these losses limit the harvesting energy bandwidth\, and we deduce the theoretical performance boundaries of piezoelectric harvesters. Finally\, we study how harvesting energy on a linear resistive load is impacted by the losses in the piezoelectric material. Experimental results are in good agreement with our analysis and show that these losses should be taken into account in the electromechanical models in order to accurately predict the harvestable power from a linear piezoelectric harvester.;hal-01865139;https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01865139

Research on how to increase the efficiency of the thermal production from renewable energy are therefore of the foremost importance. This study aims to investigate the energy performance of an integral collector storage (ICS) prototype for DHW production. This ICS represents a new concept technology\, integrating inside the same device a flat plate absorber and a storage section with phase change material (PCM) connected by heat pipes filled with methanol. An objective of this study was to investigate a possible alternative to conventional solar systems\, with the aim of reducing investment costs and improving system reliability without compromising energy performance. The energy assessment was carried out using a numerical model in the Engineering Equation Solver (EES) environment\, following an electrical analogy scheme. After a validation process by means of experimental data\, a yearly simulation was launched in order to estimate the productivity and the solar fraction of the prototype.

Automated methods based on grayscale values already exist\, but they only allow a density estimation over the whole breast. Material decomposition approaches make it possible to define the breast density at each pixel based on a dual energy exposure. Furthermore\, the use of contrast enhanced digital mammography exams is increasing and helps physicians to highlight blood vessels with higher permeability that may be related to malignant lesions. Nevertheless\, this technique also requires two x-ray exposures. In this paper\, we propose to take benefit of energy sensitive x-ray detectors that give access to several energy measurements in a single shot acquisition to both quantify breast density and iodine during a single mammography exam. To this purpose\, a spectral mammography acquisition chain has been simulated and different material decomposition methods have been proposed and investigated using a simulated phantom under clinically achievable settings with an average absorbed dose by the mammary gland of 0.93 mGy (mimicking a 45 mm thick breast made of 50% fibroglandular tissue) using a 49 kVp with a tungsten anode\, an inherent filtration of 0.8 mmBe and an additional filtration of 1.2 mmAl. Breast density is commonly defined as the ratio between glandular tissue and the sum of adipose and glandular tissues thicknesses. Standard polynomial material decomposition methods have been extended to make them compliant with 3-energy measurements in order to allow a three-material decomposition: adipose and glandular tissues as well as iodine concentration. Those methods allow to estimate iodine concentration with an average accuracy inferior to 0.15 mg ml?1 and breast density with a precision inferior to 8% (root-mean-square errors). Nevertheless\, these methods are difficult to extend to more energy channels due to the least-square model inversion. To achieve better results\, a maximum log-likelihood approach has been introduced to take into consideration more spectral information while improving accuracy and precision on measurements. Moreover\, the use of the proposed method permits to accurately detect the absence of iodine and significantly improves the estimation of breast density compared to polynomial approaches. We also highlighted that there is a strong interest to increase the number of energy thresholds from 3 to 6\, a less significant gain is still noticeable with more energy bins.;hal-01722886;https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01722886

There is additional ageing of their envelope and core material. Accelerated experiments are carried out in order to better understand this ageing process but they are not sufficient to predict the long term performance of panels. Models have to be used to connect the short term evaluation and the long term behaviours in order to improve the prediction of the thermal conductivity evolution over 50 years. This paper describes the development of a VIP model in the Dymola ® software. This model takes into account the envelope and core material hydro-thermal characteristics and behaviours\, and integrates the actual solicitations of the panels during accelerated ageing tests. The thermo-activation of the envelope permeance is integrated. Many properties of the core material are modelized: type of core material\, sorption isotherm\, hygro-thermal ageing\, pore size distribution\, etc. Simulations in constant conditions in temperature and humidity have been carried out. The results show that the real behaviour of the VIPs conductivity can't be simply evaluated through a linear extension of its short-term evolution. Given the important impact of the core material detailed characteristics\, it is absolutely necessary to get an accurate determination of the core material sorption curve and of the ageing of this curve.;hal-01822407;http://hal.univ-smb.fr/hal-01822407

Using Brewer Bsi5150 adhesive material\, 275 A degrees C appears as the optimal bonding temperature in order to optimize the TTV from 55 A mu m down to 5 A mu m. The adherence of the structure is also increased with high bonding temperatures. Indeed\, the adherence energy is above 10 J/m(2) when the temperature is above 250 A degrees C. On the contrary\, when the temperature is less than 150 A degrees C\, the adherence is only around 1 J/m(2).

Non-linear extraction strategies such as Synchronous Electrical Charge Extraction (SECE) [1-2]\, energy investing [3] or Synchronized Switch Harvesting on Inductor (SSHI) [4] have been developed to maximize the extracted energy from harmonic excitations. However\, in most of today's applications\, vibrations are not periodic and mechanical shocks occur at unpredictable rates [4]. SSHI interfaces naturally seemed to be the most appropriate candidate for harvesting shocks as they exhibit outstanding performance in periodic excitations [4]. However\, the SSHI strategy presents inherent weaknesses while harvesting shocks\, since the invested energy stored in the piezoelectric capacitance cannot be recovered. In this work\, we propose a self-starting\, battery-less\, 0.55mm 2 integrated energy harvesting interface based on SECE strategy which has been optimized to work under shock stimulus. Due to the sporadic nature of mechanical shocks which imply long periods of inactivity and brief energy peaks\, the interface's average consumption is optimized by minimizing the quiescent power. A dedicated energy saving sequencing has thus been designed\, reducing the static current to 30nA and enabling energy to be extracted with only one single 8µJ shock occurring every 100s. Our SECE-based circuit features a shock FoM 1.6x greater than previous SSHI-based interfaces [4]. The proposed system depicted in Fig.1 is made of a negative voltage converter rectifying the PEH output voltage\, and a SECE power path controlled by a sequenced circuit. The sequencing is divided in 4 phases and the associated time diagrams are illustrated in Fig.2. During the sleeping mode T1\, all blocks except the shock detection (SD) are turned off. During the starting phase\, the energy is stored in CASIC through a cold-start path\, increasing VASIC. This will progressively turn on the SD.

The title material crystallizes in the triclinic system\, space group P-1 with a = 6.521(4) Å\, b = 9.623(6) Å\, c = 10.969(7) Å\, ?=64.23(2) ?\, ?= 80.14(3) ? and ?= 72.10(2) ?. The structure presents Co4P4O28groups formed by two Co2O11units and two P2O7groups. The junction between these groups is assured by two pyrophosphates to create a three-dimensional anionic framework showing interconnecting tunnels in a\, band caxis. The obtained structural model is supported by two validations tools: Charge Distribution (CHARDIT) analysis and Bond Valence Sum (BVS) calculation which validated the presence of Co2+and Co3+in the same sites. The Ag+cations balanced the negative charge with partial site occupations. The Ag+ pathways simulation\, using the Bond Valence Site Energy(BVSE) model\, identified the mobile species and proposed migration pathways of the monovalent cations according vast tunnels in three dimensions. The material must be a 3D average ionic conductor\, with theoretical activation energy about 1.7 eV. Correlation between structure and electricalproperties has been discussed.;hal-02133646;https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-02133646

Independently\, silicon has emerged as highly promising in lithium-ion battery anodes because of its absorbing 10 times more lithium than the standard carbon anodes. Silicon in battery anodes is submitted to intense mechanical constraints due to lithiation-delithiation\, that only very small crystals can handle. Silicon nanowires then appeared as particularly efficient as they can withstand such constraints and maintain battery cycling over several hundreds of cycles. However\, silicon nanowires grown as thin films do not fit as material for lithium-ion batteries\, neither in terms of mass produced nor in terms of production cost: even a coin cell contains several milligrams of anode material\, while silicon nanowires are grown at ?g/cm2 by CVD. We recently patented [1] a new technology of silicon nanowire synthesis designed for mass production as a powder. The nanowires are grown in a glass or steel reactor at medium temperature (430°C) from metal nanoparticles deposited on an inert support\, and from an air-stable organosilane as the silicon source. Table salt (NaCl) is usually used as a support that can be conveniently removed by washing with water after growth. Growth on salt also avoids handling silicon nanowires as a dry powder\, preventing risk of inhaling nanoparticles. The synthesis yields silicon nanowires in gram scale\, with a yield of 70-80%. Tests of the pure silicon nanowires in lithium-metal batteries show an excellent capacity retention over 1000 cycles.;hal-01976066;https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01976066

This study\, describes the state-of-the-art of cement modelling in IAMs\, suggests possible improvements and discusses the impacts of these on energy and greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) in the IMAGE global IAM. It is found that two cement-sector specific GHG mitigation measures are often not explicitly accounted for in IAMs\, namely: (i) retrofitting and (ii) reducing the clinker to cement ratio. For retrofitting\, many measures are identified as cost-effective and when incorporating these in the IMAGE model overall energy use reduces between 2010 and 2035 by 9.8 and 11 EJ (4% and 5%) under the baseline and GHG mitigation scenarios\, respectively. When incorporating the clinker to cement ratio by linking material availability to the activities in the steel industry and coal-fired power plants\, the 2050 energy use reduces by 15% under the baseline scenario and increases by 9% under the GHG mitigation scenario as fewer coal-fired power plants are in operation. This is even more prominent in the long term. The 2100 energy use is 14% higher in the GHG mitigation scenario as even fewer coal-fired power plants are used drastically limiting the potential for clinker substitution with fly ash. These results highlight the importance of capturing cross-sectoral relationships between industries and of including sector specific mitigation measures in long-term energy models.;hal-02061441;https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-02061441

It is possible to overcome this limit by combining silicon with high-bandgap materials\, such as III–V semiconductors\, in a multi-junction device. Significant challenges associated with this material combination have hindered the development of highly efficient III–V/Si solar cells. Here\, we demonstrate a III–V/Si cell reaching similar performances to standard III–V/Ge triple-junction solar cells. This device is fabricated using wafer bonding to permanently join a GaInP/GaAs top cell with a silicon bottom cell. The key issues of III–V/Si interface recombination and silicon's weak absorption are addressed using poly-silicon/SiO$_x$ passivating contacts and a novel rear-side diffraction grating for the silicon bottom cell. With these combined features\, we demonstrate a two-terminal GaInP/GaAs//Si solar cell reaching a 1-sun AM1.5G conversion efficiency of 33.3%.;cea-01882171;https://hal-cea.archives-ouvertes.fr/cea-01882171

This problem\, referred to as material decomposition\, can be formulated as a nonlinear inverse problem. In previous work\, we proposed to decompose the projection images using a regularized Gauss-Newton algorithm. To reduce further the ill-posedness of the problem\, we propose here to consider equality and inequality constraints that are based on physical priors. In particular\, we impose the positivity of the solutions as well the total mass in each projection image. In practice\, we first decompose the projection images for each projection angle independently. Then\, we reconstruct the sample slices from the decomposed projection images using a standard filtered-back projection algorithm. The constrained material decomposition problem is solved by the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). We compare the proposed ADMM algorithm to the unconstrained Gauss-Newton algorithm in a numerical thorax phantom. Including constraints reduces the cross-talk between materials in both the decomposed projections and the reconstructed slices.;hal-01909643;https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01909643

Where is this special behaviour coming from? In this work\, the reversible sodiation–desodiation reaction of SnSb was investigated by simultaneous operando Sn and Sb K-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy along with operando119Sn Mössbauer spectroscopy. Chemometric tools such as principal component analysis and multivariate curve resolution – alternating least squares were used to analyse the whole data sets to gain information on the nature and sequence of formation of different species during electrochemical cycling vs. Na. The obtained results indicate that the sodiation reaction is a two-step process clearly distinct from the reaction of SnSb vs. Li. Firstly Sb is sodiated to form Na3Sb and an intermediate phase of nanosized metallic Sn\, which we were able to identify as ?-Sn\, commonly unstable at ambient conditions. During the second step\, this tin phase is fully sodiated to form Na15Sn4\, as rarely observed for pure Sn-based electrodes. Finally\, EXAFS analysis proves that the amorphous SnSb phase formed after one complete cycle is clearly distinct from the pristine material. These new insights on the mechanism of SnSb vs. Na provide a basis for understanding the exceptional electrochemical performance\, which is superior not only to SnSb vs. Li but also to Sn vs. Na. The key to the enhanced cycle life and capacity retention lies in the gradual formation of amorphous\, nano-confined intermediate phases and correlated elastic softening of highly sodiated tin and antimony phases which have enhanced ability to absorb and mitigate the strong volume changes occurring upon sodiation and desodiation.;hal-01789170;https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01789170

As this delay is far too long to obtain useful information regarding in-service degradation\, accelerated approaches to weathering testing are performed by manufacturers and research laboratories in order to quickly assess the lifetime of commercial or new technologies. However\, most published studies that have been performed in the CSP field are based on phenomenological approaches. The characterization of the degradation\, which mostly considers reflectance loss\, has rarely been linked to physical or chemical processes that are responsible for the degradation of properties. Furthermore\, the general laws that can be established from these data to establish material behaviour are empirical. Ageing tests have been used for many years in other fields\, particularly in the domain of polymeric materials. The impacts on the material properties of stress factors such as temperature\, irradiation and humidity have been extensively studied\, and models have been proposed for different kinds of materials\, even though most are based on empirical observations. One of the goals of this article is to determine how these models could be applied to the weathering of solar mirrors\, and as such\, the goal of this paper is to provide a critical review of the various models that are most used and accepted by the scientific community.

Optical\, thermal and dielectric properties have been examined as a function of ZnO nanoparticles. The absorption optical spectra exhibit a broad intense peak assigned to the n–?* (HOMO–LUMO) transitions. Nanocomposite with 3.0 wt% ZnO sample completely blocks UV-light radiations in the region from 300 to 480 nm\, which allowed that the prepared material to be used for UV-Shielding devices. The optical band gap is found to decrease with increasing filler ZnO concentrations. This might be due to increasing the density of defect states. Permittivity and electric modulus formalisms are used to analyze and interpret the experimental data. ? relaxation is observed in the low temperature region\, which is attributed to the rearrangement of small parts of the polymeric chains. The ? relaxation and the Maxwell–Wagner–Sillars (MWS) effect\, attributed to the glass rubber transition of the polymeric matrix and the interfacial polarization phenomena respectively\, are observed in the high temperature region. Using Havriliak–Negami approach\, the temperature dependence of relaxation time for MWS and ? relaxations follows an Arrhenius behavior while the ? relaxation time is well described by the Vogel–Fulcher–Tamann behavior. The activation energies of all relaxation modes were calculated and discussed. The energy density of the investigated samples is significantly enhanced. It is about 2?×?10?6 J/m3 for nanocomposite with 3.0 wt% ZnO at 20 °C. These results indicate that the effect of ZnO nanoparticles makes the proposed materials suitable candidates for energy storage applications.;hal-02023799;https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-02023799

The aim of the present study is to introduce a reconstruction method which solves both problems simultaneously: a "" one-step "" approach. An explicit linear detector model is used and characterized by a Detector Response Matrix (DRM). The algorithm reconstructs two basis material maps from energy-window transmission data. The results prove that the simultaneous inversion of both problems is well performed for simulation data.

The optimization of the performances of such hybrid photoelectrodes requires a detailed understanding of the light-driven electron transfer processes occurring first at the interface between the semiconducting material and the dye and then between the dye and the catalytic center. Here we address the first of these issues and use quantum chemistry to determine the structural and electronic features of the interfaces between a push-pull dye and the p-NiO (100) surface.

Its formation is associated with the high internal strains induced by the compression of the soft tissues under the ischium [1]. 3D Finite Element (FE) models have been developed to estimate internal strains in the subdermal soft tissues. Some authors have also investigated the influence of the material properties of the soft tissues [2]. However\, the interval of variation of the parameters in these sensitivity studies are not necessarily representative of the variability of subgroups of population. In this contribution\, we investigate the influence of using the material properties of one given individual (generic material properties) as representative of a population. The generic material properties were obtained by Finite Element Updating to fit the experimental sagging of the pelvis of one subject when sitting. The 3D subject-specific FE model was generated from the combination of bi-planar Radiography\, ultrasound imaging and optical scanner and is composed of the pelvis (rigid body) and 3 homogeneous layers representing the muscle tissue\, fat and skin. The adipose tissue and the muscle layer were modelled as an Ogden quasi-incompressible hyperelastic material. The same material parameters were used to estimate the pelvis sagging of 7 healthy subjects. The estimated sagging was compared to the experimental one measured by computing the vertical displacements of both ischial tuberosities visible on the radiographs before and after sitting (Figure 1). For 5 subjects\, the differences between both were below 1mm. For the two other subjects\, the differences were 4 and 6 mm. These findings suggest that using generic material properties allow to reproduce the biomechanical response of the buttock when sitting for healthy subjects. The same approach could be applied to spinal cord injury population\, which will allow to clarify the necessity of personalizing the material properties in models developed for this population.;hal-02307087;https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-02307087

The phantom is created from experimental synchrotron CT mono-energetic images. After simulating spectral CT data\, we perform material decomposition using Gauss-Newton method\, for different noise levels. Then\, we reconstruct virtual mono-energetic images. We compare decompositions and mono-energetic images with the phantom using mean-squared error.

It consists in significantly increasing the thickness of the storage layer in out-of-plane magnetized tunnel junctions (pMTJ) as compared to conventional pMTJ in order to induce a perpendicular shape anisotropy (PSA) in this layer. This PSA is obtained by depositing a thick ferromagnetic (FM) layer on top of an MgO/FeCoB based magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) so that the thickness of the storage layer becomes of the order or larger than the diameter of the MTJ pillar. In contrast to conventional spin transfer torque magnetic random access memory (STT-MRAM) wherein the demagnetizing energy opposes the interfacial perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (iPMA)\, in these novel memory cells\, both PSA and iPMA contributions favor out-of-plane orientation of the storage layer magnetization. Using thicker storage layers in these PSA-STT-MRAM has several advantages. Thanks to the PSA\, very high and easily tunable thermal stability factors can be achieved\, even down to sub-10 nm diameters. Moreover\, low damping material can be used for the thick FM material thus leading to a reduction of the write current. The paper describes this new PSA-STT-MRAM concept\, practical realization of such memory arrays\, magnetic characterization demonstrating thermal stability factor above 200 for MTJs as small as 8nm in diameter and possibility to maintain thermal stability factor above 60 down to 4nm diameter.;hal-01824092;https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01824092

In the single-layered SrTiOD material\, hydride anions are statistically disordered with oxides on the apical site only\, as opposed to known transition-metal oxyhydrides exhibiting a preferred occupation of the equatorial site. This unprecedented site selectivity of H has been reproduced by periodic DFT+ U calculations\, emphasizing for the hydride defect a difference in formation energy of 0.24 eV between equatorial and apical sites. In terms of electronic structure\, the model system SrTiOH is found to be slightly metallic and the released electron remains mostly delocalized over several Ti atoms. On the other hand\, hydride anions in the double-layered SrTiOH material show a clear preference for the bridging apical site within the perovskite slabs\, as confirmed by DFT calculations on the SrTiOH model system. Finally\, the influence of the B-site chemical nature on the hydride site selectivity for early 3d transition metals is theoretically explored in the single-layered system by substituting vanadium for titanium.

Here we demonstrate that chiral spin textures are induced at graphene/ferromagnetic metal interfaces. Graphene is a weak spin–orbit coupling material and is generally not expected to induce a sufficient Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya interaction to affect magnetic chirality. We demonstrate that indeed graphene does induce a type of Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya interaction due to the Rashba effect. First-principles calculations and experiments using spin-polarized electron microscopy show that this graphene-induced Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya interaction can have a similar magnitude to that at interfaces with heavy metals.

In the case of the High Luminosity upgrade of the LHC\, the luminosity is raised by increasing the number of simultaneous proton-proton interactions\, so-called pile-up. This increases the expected yields of signal and background processes alike. The signal is embedded in a large background of processes that mimic that of signal events. It is therefore imperative for the experiments to develop new triggering methods to effectively distinguish the interesting events from the background. We present a comparison of two methods for filtering detector hits to be used for triggering on particle tracks: one based on a pattern matching technique using Associative Memory (AM) chips and the other based on the Hough transform. Their efficiency and hit rejection are evaluated for proton-proton collisions with varying amounts of pile-up using a simulation of a generic silicon tracking detector. It is found that\, while both methods are feasible options for a track trigger with single muon efficiencies around 98–99%\, the AM based pattern matching produces a lower number of hit combinations with respect to the Hough transform whilst keeping more of the true signal hits. We also present the effect on the two methods of increasing the amount of support material in the detector and of introducing inefficiencies by deactivating detector modules. The increased support material has negligable effects on the efficiency for both methods\, while dropping 5% (10%) of the available modules decreases the efficiency to about 95% (87%) for both methods\, irrespective of the amount of pile-up.;hal-01797867;https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01797867

Tongue as a combination of various muscles is surrounded by the mucous membrane and is a complicated architecture to study. As a first step before the quantitative mechanical characterization of human tongue tissues\, the passive biomechanical properties in the superior longitudinal muscle (SLM) and the mucous tissues of a bovine tongue have been measured. Since the rate of loading has a sizeable contribution to the resultant stress of soft tissues\, the rate dependent behavior of tongue tissues has been investigated via uniaxial tension tests (UTTs). A method to determine the mechanical properties of transversely isotropic tissues using UTTs and inverse finite element (FE) method has been proposed. Assuming the strain energy as a general nonlinear relationship with respect to the stretch and the rate of stretch\, two visco-hyperelastic constitutive laws (CLs) have been proposed for isotropic and transversely isotropic soft tissues to model their stress-stretch behavior. Both of them have been implemented in ABAQUS explicit through coding a user-defined material subroutine called VUMAT and the experimental stress-stretch points have been well tracked by the results of FE analyses. It has been demonstrated that the proposed laws make a good description of the viscous nature of tongue tissues.

RE is attracting scientific studies because of its sustainable properties : a very low embodied energy and an advantageous living comfort due to a particular benefic hygro-thermal behaviour. Numerous studies have been conducted to investigate RE material and RE structures\, however\, a lack of knowledge on the seismic performance of RE buildings is noticed. This paper presents an advanced numerical study to investigate the in-plane seismic behaviour of RE walls. First\, a numerical model of an in-situ RE wall was constructed by using discrete element modelling (DEM). The relevancy of the numerical model was verified by comparing dynamic properties of the model with that measured on the in-situ wall. Then\, a real earthquake excitation was applied to the model\, in order to evaluate the seismic performance of the RE wall studied. This is the first time\, to our knowledge\, that a dynamic discrete explicite analysis was performed for a RE wall. The excitation was scaled at different amplitudes to assess the damages following different earthquake intensities. The results showed that for seismic excitations lower than 2.3?m/s2\, RE walls studied had satisfying in-plane earthquake performance.;hal-02069655;https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-02069655

The Silicon Charge Detector (SCD)\, placed at the top of the ISS-CREAM payload\, consists of 4 layers. Each layer has 2688 silicon pixels and associated electronics arranged in such a fashion that its active detection area of 78.2 × 73.6?cm 2 is free of dead area. The foremost goal of the SCD is to efficiently and precisely measure the charge of cosmic rays passing through it. The 4-layer configuration was chosen to achieve the best precision in measuring the charge of cosmic rays within the constraints on the mass\, volume and power allotted to it. The amount of material used for its support structure was minimized as well to reduce the chance of interactions of the cosmic ray within the structure. Given the placement of the SCD\, its 4-layer configuration and the minimal amount of material in the cosmic-ray trajectory\, the SCD is designed to measure the charge of cosmic rays ranging from protons to iron nuclei with excellent detection efficiency and charge resolution. We present the design and fabrication of the SCD as well as its performance during space environment tests which it underwent successfully. We also present its performance in charge measurement using heavy ions in a beam test at CERN\, the European Organization for Nuclear Research.;hal-02266345;https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-02266345

While the overall optical spectra of these Mott insulators are governed by transitions between the Hubbard bands\, distinct in-gap excitations can be identified at low temperatures and frequencies\, which we attribute to the quantum-spin-liquid state. For the strongly correlated ? ?-EtMe3Sb[Pd(dmit)2]2\, we discover enhanced conductivity below 175 cm ?1 \, comparable to the energy of the magnetic coupling J ? 250 K. For ? ? 0 these low-frequency excitations vanish faster than the charge-carrier response subject to Mott-Hubbard correlations\, resulting in a dome-shape band peaked at 100 cm ?1. Possible relations to spinons\, magnons and disorder are discussed. PACS numbers: 75.10.Kt 71.30.+h\, 74.25.Gz 78.30.Jw Quantum spin liquids are an intriguing state of matter [1-4]: although the spins interact strongly\, the combination of geometrical frustration and quantum fluctuations prevents long-range magnetic order even in two and three dimensions. It took decades before clear experimental realizations of this theoretical concept [5\, 6] became available\, first in the organic compound ?-(BE-DT-TTF) 2 Cu 2 (CN) 3 \, which crystallizes in a triangular pattern [7]\, and later in the kagome lattice of ZnCu 3-(OH) 6 Cl 2 [8-10]. Despite this progress\, a smoking-gun experiment identifying its essential features is still lacking \, and even a reliable theoretical description of real spin-liquid systems remains a subject of much dispute. At present\, the fundamental nature of the spin-liquid state is far from being understood. The intensely studied quantum-spin-liquid candidate Herbertsmithite (ZnCu 3 (OH) 6 Cl 2) shows no magnetic order and no indications of a spin gap down to 0.1 meV\, inferring that the spin excitations form a continuum [2]. This important issue\, however\, is far from being settled neither from the experimental nor from the theoretical side [11\, 12]; the discussion on the nature of the quantum-spin-liquid state is rather controversial [13-19]. In this Letter we investigate the electrodynamic response of three organic quantum spin liquids. While close to the Mott transition the charge degrees of freedom dominate the conductivity\, our optical experiments reveal considerable low-frequency absorption deep inside the Mott-insulating state. The observed dome-like feature is confined by the exchange energy J\, suggesting a relation to the spin degrees of freedom and exotic spin-charge coupling. We study the charge-transfer salts ?-(BEDT-TTF) 2-Cu 2 (CN) 3 (abbreviated CuCN\, BEDT-TTF denotes bis(ethylenedithio)tetrathiafulvalene)\, ?-(BEDT-TTF) 2-Ag 2 (CN) 3 (called AgCN) and ? ?-EtMe 3 Sb[Pd(dmit) 2 ] 2 (short EtMe\, here EtMe 3 Sb stands for ethyltrimethylsti-bonium and dmit is 1\,3-dithiole-2-thione-4\,5-dithiolate)\, where the molecular dimers with spin-1 2 form a highly frustrated triangular lattice [7\, 20-22]. At ambient pressure no indication of Néel order is observed at temperatures as low as 20 mK\, despite the considerable antifer-romagnetic exchange of J ? 220 ? 250 K. The origin of the spin-liquid phase is unresolved since the geometrical frustration introduced by a triangular lattice should not be sufficient to stabilize the quantum-spin-liquid state for ordinary Heisenberg exchange interactions [23-25]. Recently it was proposed that\, alternatively\, intrinsic disorder [26-28] or dynamical fluctuations [29] may play a crucial role for stabilizing the spin-liquid state in these molecular materials. In contrast to the completely insulating material Her-bertsmithite\, where the on-site Coulomb repulsion U and bandwidth W are in the eV range (U = 8 eV [30])\, the energy scales of these organic compounds are significantly smaller; here\, k B T has a large effect on the Mott gap already for a few hundred Kelvins as evident in dc transport [22\, 28\, 31]. Moreover\, the molecular conductors under study are closer to the metallic phase due to weaker correlations. With U/W ? 1.5\, CuCN is almost at the metal-insulator transition; in fact it becomes supercon-ducting at T c = 3.6 K under hydrostatic pressure of only 4 kbar [7]. For AgCN the effective correlations are more pronounced\, as U/W = 2\, while EtMe is far on the Mott insulating side with U/W ? 2.4 [32]. Heat capacity measurements suggested gapless spin excitations for CuCN";hal-01907895;https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01907895

The challenge to achieve a high temperature data retention without compromising the device programming speed can be addressed by material engineering. We show that volume and thermal confinement improvement of the phase-change material enables a high (10-fold) reduction of the programming current\, achieved also by the optimization of the device architecture\, in particular in the case of a confined structure. It leads to a higher cell efficiency proven by a 6x reduction of the programming current density wrt a standard PCM structure. Furthermore\, we demonstrate the reduction of thermal losses by the tuning of the thermal conductivity of the dielectrics surrounding the phase-change material. Finally\, we propose some considerations about the PCM ultimate scaling and the reliability at such dimensions\, showing that the engineering of the bottom electrode/phase-change material interface can lead to a reduced variability in scaled devices.;cea-02185419;https://hal-cea.archives-ouvertes.fr/cea-02185419

Field-trapping mitigates the problem of UCN loss on material surfaces\, which caused the largest correction in prior neutron experiments using material bottles. However\, the neutron dynamics in field traps differ qualitatively from those in material bottles. In the latter case\, neutrons bounce off material surfaces with significant diffusivity and the population quickly reaches a static spatial distribution with a density gradient induced by the gravitational potential. In contrast\, the field-confined UCN—whose dynamics can be described by Hamiltonian mechanics—do not exhibit the stochastic behaviors typical of an ideal gas model as observed in material bottles. In this report\, we will describe our efforts to simulate UCN trapping in the UCN? magnetogravitational trap. We compare the simulation output to the experimental results to determine the parameters of the neutron detector and the input neutron distribution. The tuned model is then used to understand the phase-space evolution of neutrons observed in the UCN? experiment. We will discuss the implications of chaotic dynamics on controlling the systematic effects\, such as spectral cleaning and microphonic heating\, for a successful UCN lifetime experiment to reach a 0.01% level of precision.;hal-01909541;https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01909541
