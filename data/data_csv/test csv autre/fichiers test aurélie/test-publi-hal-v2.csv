Three different single phase metallic glasses and three composites (two with amor-phous/crystalline Cu and one with an amorphous/amorphous structure) were investigated. The state of the materials was additionally changed by varying the testing temperature between room temperature and 430 °C\";by performing high pressure torsion and by thermal cycling. The results show that testing temperature is the main parameter controlling activation volume and energy\;"whereas material modifications by high pressure torsion and thermal cycling do not significantly affect them.;hal-01807726;https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01807726";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Piezoelectric ceramics exhibit conductive and dielectric losses. However\;in most models used in energy harvesting\;these losses are disregarded\;as they appear to be relatively small in manufacturer datasheets. In this paper\;after briefly introducing the origins of those losses\;we experimentally prove that they are strongly dependent on the electric field in the material. This means that the datasheets data\;obtained under low electric field characterizations\;are not representative of the actual material losses under real-world vibrations. Thereafter\;we prove that these losses limit the harvesting energy bandwidth\;and we deduce the theoretical performance boundaries of piezoelectric harvesters. Finally\;"we study how harvesting energy on a linear resistive load is impacted by the losses in the piezoelectric material. Experimental results are in good agreement with our analysis and show that these losses should be taken into account in the electromechanical models in order to accurately predict the harvestable power from a linear piezoelectric harvester.;hal-01865139;https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01865139"

With the new directives promoted by the European Union the renewable energy share produced in buildings will tend to increase further. Research on how to increase the efficiency of the thermal production from renewable energy are therefore of the foremost importance. This study aims to investigate the energy performance of an integral collector storage (ICS) prototype for DHW production. This ICS represents a new concept technology\";integrating inside the same device a flat plate absorber and a storage section with phase change material (PCM) connected by heat pipes filled with methanol. An objective of this study was to investigate a possible alternative to conventional solar systems\;with the aim of reducing investment costs and improving system reliability without compromising energy performance. The energy assessment was carried out using a numerical model in the Engineering Equation Solver (EES) environment\;following an electrical analogy scheme. After a validation process by means of experimental data\;"a yearly simulation was launched in order to estimate the productivity and the solar fraction of the prototype. The results obtained allowed a global energy evaluation and a comparison with similar systems and to identify the pros and cons of this new technology.;hal-02172156;http://hal.univ-smb.fr/hal-02172156";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Automated methods based on grayscale values already exist\";but they only allow a density estimation over the whole breast. Material decomposition approaches make it possible to define the breast density at each pixel based on a dual energy exposure. Furthermore\;the use of contrast enhanced digital mammography exams is increasing and helps physicians to highlight blood vessels with higher permeability that may be related to malignant lesions. Nevertheless\;this technique also requires two x-ray exposures. In this paper\;we propose to take benefit of energy sensitive x-ray detectors that give access to several energy measurements in a single shot acquisition to both quantify breast density and iodine during a single mammography exam. To this purpose\;a spectral mammography acquisition chain has been simulated and different material decomposition methods have been proposed and investigated using a simulated phantom under clinically achievable settings with an average absorbed dose by the mammary gland of 0.93 mGy (mimicking a 45 mm thick breast made of 50% fibroglandular tissue) using a 49 kVp with a tungsten anode\;an inherent filtration of 0.8 mmBe and an additional filtration of 1.2 mmAl. Breast density is commonly defined as the ratio between glandular tissue and the sum of adipose and glandular tissues thicknesses. Standard polynomial material decomposition methods have been extended to make them compliant with 3-energy measurements in order to allow a three-material decomposition: adipose and glandular tissues as well as iodine concentration. Those methods allow to estimate iodine concentration with an average accuracy inferior to 0.15 mg ml?1 and breast density with a precision inferior to 8% (root-mean-square errors). Nevertheless\;these methods are difficult to extend to more energy channels due to the least-square model inversion. To achieve better results\;a maximum log-likelihood approach has been introduced to take into consideration more spectral information while improving accuracy and precision on measurements. Moreover\;the use of the proposed method permits to accurately detect the absence of iodine and significantly improves the estimation of breast density compared to polynomial approaches. We also highlighted that there is a strong interest to increase the number of energy thresholds from 3 to 6\;"a less significant gain is still noticeable with more energy bins.;hal-01722886;https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01722886";;;;;;;;
