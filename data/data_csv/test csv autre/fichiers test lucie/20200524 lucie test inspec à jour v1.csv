USA.;2019;Saratov Fall Meeting 2019: Optical and Nano-Technologies for Biology and Medicine. Saratov, Russia. 23-27 Sept. 2019.;Laser surgery of the changing cartilage shape is based on photothermal effect on tissue components, which leads to its plasticization and, consequently, reshaping of this tissue. With the rapid laser heating, an optoacoustic wave is generated in the tissue, by the propagation and amplitude of which one can understand the changes in the mechanical properties of the tissue. In this work, data were obtained on the relative time variation of the mechanical stresses of the cartilage tissue upon heating and its temporal characteristics (relaxation time and system response time). A simultaneous recording of the electrical conductivity response of the cartilaginous tissue and mechanical stresses on a pulsed - periodic laser exposure is presented. As a result of this study, it was found that the mechanical stresses in the tissue are in good agreement with the electrical response of the tissue and a drop in resistance. It has been found that the continuation of tissue impedance falling down after the laser exposure switched off causes relaxation of the internal stresses. These studies are the base for the development of a control system for laser operations on cartilage tissue. (16 References).;"Optical and laser radiation (medical uses) [A8760F]

Publisher: Elsevier B.V., Netherlands.;2020;;To improve the reliability of the coating, a laser-plasma composite heat source was used to prepare the YSZ coating. Based on the thermo-elastoplastic finite element theory and using ANSYS simulation software, a numerical model of laser-plasma composite heat source for YSZ coating was established. The model took into account the thermophysical performance parameters of the material at different temperatures and the latent heat of the phase transition of the material. The paper focused on the value and distribution of the temperature and the residual stress of coatings when the powder deposition temperature was 300 degreeC, 500 degreeC, 700 degreeC, and 900 degreeC. The results showed that with the increase of powder deposition temperature, the maximum temperature of the component increased. The micro-metallurgical morphology existed at the interface between the coating and the substrate prepared by the laser-plasma composite heat source. With the increase of powder deposition temperature, the depth and width of the molten pool of the substrate tended to increase further under the combined effects of the thermal conductivity of the component itself and the convective heat transfer between the component and the external environment. With the increase of powder deposition temperature, both the lateral maximum residual tensile stress and the lateral maximum residual compressive stress of the component increased. With the increase of powder deposition temperature, the longitudinal maximum residual compressive stress of the component increased and the longitudinal maximum residual tensile stress decreased.

Si and Mg increased the strength of the Al re-solidified zone near the Ti-Al interface because of their easy dissolution in the Al. Exothermic effect of the Mg addition resulted in porosity in the welding zone. Joint strength of up to 98% of the Al base metal was obtained, which was much 14% higher than that achieved by autogenous welding. [All rights reserved Elsevier].

Publisher: Elsevier B.V., Netherlands.;2020;;Laser tube forming is a flexible process in which the heat generated by the laser beam scanning on the tube surface results in bending. Unlike laser sheet forming, few studies have been carried out on laser tube forming. This originates from the complexity of this process compared to the sheet forming, as well as the limited applicability of the forming strategies. In this research, a new idea is proposed based on the circular scanning method, which is presented in the form of two step-by-step and reverse schemes. Using this new strategy, it would be easy to precisely extract the laser scanning path for all 2D and 3D shapes. Since this strategy is programmable, it can be designed and implemented in a variety of forms only by changing the input parameters. In order to form a desired 2D and 3D shapes on a tube based on this idea, the proposed strategy was verified with both finite element and experimental methods. Fiber laser was used to form the AISI 304L tubes with certain parameters to achieve a specific bend angle. The experimental results are in a very good agreement with the designed path strategy and FE simulations, which confirms the efficiency and effectiveness of the path scanning strategy proposed in this paper.

We start with an amplitude encoded top hat converter and demonstrate how its efficiency can be further increased by introduction of phase masks and by the polarization of the incident beam.

San Francisco, CA, USA. 3-5 Feb. 2020.;The use of epoxies in space-based instruments is often unavoidable in situations where the bonding of dissimilar materials such as glass and metal is required. While there are epoxies that exhibit low total mass loss (TML) and collected volatile condensable materials (CVCM) in vacuum, in some applications they can still be a source of problematic contamination. Epoxies can also be incompatible with exposure to chemical environments some space instrumentation may be exposed to. In high power laser instruments such as LIDAR systems where optical components must be securely bonded to metal mounts, the impact of epoxy outgassing can be especially acute. Even with very low outgassing levels, the intense laser can break down the outgassed material and preferentially deposit it on optics that handle high optical power. This laser induced contamination in turn leads to laser induced damage, leading to degradation of optical components and reducing the reliability and operational lifetime of laser instruments [1-6]. Alternative bonding methods that avoid introducing additional contaminants could greatly improve reliability and operational lifetime of space instruments. (20 References).;"Reliability [B0170N]

Publisher: arXiv, USA.;2019;;The frequency stability achieved by an optical atomic clock ultimately depends on the coherence of its local oscillator. Even the best ultrastable lasers only allow interrogation times of a few seconds, at present. Here we present a universal measurement protocol that overcomes this limitation. Engineered dynamic decoupling of laser phase noise allows any optical atomic clock with high signal-to-noise ratio in a single interrogation to reconstruct the laser's phase well beyond its coherence limit. A compound clock is then formed in combination with another optical clock of any type, allowing the latter to achieve significantly higher frequency stability than on its own. We demonstrate implementation of the protocol in a realistic proof-of-principle experiment with a phase reconstruction fidelity of 99%. The protocol enables minute-long interrogation for the best ultrastable laser systems. Likewise, it can improve clock performance where less stable local oscillators are used, such as in transortable systems. (36 References).;"Time and frequency measurement [A0630F]

Chengdu, China. 6-9 Dec. 2019.;With the development of high-repetition rate laser ranging, huge amount of laser ranging data are generated. DeepLabCut is a novel automatic annotation method for markerless motion capture from Big Data. With the advantage of only small size of training dataset needed, it has been successfully applied to various research fields. However, few researches can be found related to data processing for satellite laser ranging using DeepLabCut method. In this paper, different satellite laser ranging data are simulated by two polynomials according to the characteristics of echoes and noise. Secondly, two extraction strategies of time-drift and global-uniform are proposed for key points extraction to generate training datasets as ground truth. And two training datasets including 50 key points from 10 frames and 5 frames are generated, respectively. Then, deep neural networks are trained using DeepLabCut based on the training datasets. Finally, satellite laser ranging data as videos are tested with the trained neural networks. Results show that the key points suffered from drift and mismatching without uniform distribution, which indicates that DeepLabCut is not an applicable method based on the two proposed extraction strategies for satellite laser ranging data processing. Possible reasons including image textures, indiscrimination of echoes and noise are concluded. The simulation analysis in this paper is useful for deciding whether to apply DeepLabCut to process satellite laser ranging data. (12 References).;"Optical radar [B6320C]
