Nonlinear interaction of laser modes,1963,journal article,European Physical Journal,,H. Haken;" H. Sauermann,""The interaction of N atoms each with 3 levels at random lattice sites with a set of cavity modes is considered. The optical transition between the lowest two atomic levels is taken into account explicitely assuming a Lorentzian line shape, whereas the third level just serves for the pumping process. If homogeneous inversion of the atoms is assumed, only one coherent mode oscillates in the steady state. It is the one being closest to the atomic resonance and having highestQ. If, however, in the next approximation a mode-dependent depletion of the excited atomic states is taken into account, with increasing pumping rate several modes may oscillate simultaneously. The behaviour of two such modes is treated in detail and it is shown, that one obtains a stable configuration. Using a higher approximation the nonlinear interaction between these two modes brought about by the amplifying material is studied in detail. As a special result one obtains a repulsion of the frequencies of the modes as a function of pumping power in accordance with gaslaser experiments. Quantum noise effects are neglected throughout the present paper."",173,3,261,275,Resonance"; Quantum noise; Physics; Nonlinear system; Excited state; Atom; Atomic physics; Oscillation; Steady state; Nuclear fusion,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01377828,10.1007/bf01377828,;;;;;;;;;;;
Effect of Post Laser Shock Peening on Microstructure and Mechanical Properties of Inconel 718 by Selective Laser Melting,2019,conference proceedings article,Volume 2: Processes; Materials,American Society of Mechanical Engineers,Kuldeep Singh Sidhu; Yachao Wang; Jing Shi; Vijay K. Vasudevan;" Seetha R. Mannava,""<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>";"                <jats:p>This study investigates the effects of laser shock peening (LSP) on residual stress, near surface modification, and hardness of Inconel 718 (IN718) specimens manufactured by selective laser melting (SLM) technique. Optical microscope and electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD) is used to characterize the microstructures of both heat-treated and as-built specimens. A nanoindentation test is performed to determine the properties such as the hardness of as-built and heat-treated specimens. Afterward, the hardness along the distance from the LSP treated surface is also defined. To investigate the effect of LSP energy on the mechanical properties of specimens, two levels of LSP energy, e.g., low energy LSP (6.37 GW/cm2) and high energy LSP (8.60 GW/cm2), are carried out on selected samples. With the increase in laser energy density, it is found that both compressive residual stress and hardness increase after LSP treatment. The as-built specimens after high energy LSP treatment show the compressive residual stress of −875 MPa, and the surface hardness increases from 468 HV to 853 HV.</jats:p>"",,,,,Metallurgy"; Materials science; Selective laser melting; Inconel; Laser; Peening; Microstructure,,,,https://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/MSEC/proceedings/MSEC2019/58752/V002T03A071/1070870,10.1115/msec2019-2893,;;;;;;;;;

Stable laser-produced quasimonoenergetic proton beams from interactive laser and target shaping,2013,journal article,Physical Review Special Topics-accelerators and Beams,American Physical Society,J. L. Liu; Min Chen; Zheng-Ming Sheng; Chuan-Sheng Liu; Warren Mori;" J. Zhang,""In radiation pressure dominated laser ion acceleration schemes, transverse target deformation and Rayleigh-Taylor (RT)-like instability always develop quickly, break the acceleration structure, limit the final accelerated ion energy, and lower the beam quality. To overcome these issues, we propose a target design named dual parabola targets consisting of a lateral thick part and a middle thin part, each with a parabolic front surface of different focus positions. By using such a target, through interactive laser and target shaping processes, the central part of the thin target will detach from the whole target and a microtarget is formed. This enables the stable acceleration of the central part of the target to high energy with high quality since usual target deformation and RT-like instabilities with planar targets are suppressed. Furthermore, this target design reduces the laser intensity required to optimize radiation pressure acceleration by more than 1 order of magnitude compared to normal flat targets with similar thickness and density. Two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations indicate that a quasimonoenergetic proton beam with peak energy over 200 MeV and energy spread around 2% can be generated when such a solid target (with density 400nc and target thickness 0.5λ0) is irradiated by a 100 fs long circularly polarized laser pulse at focused intensity IL∼9.2×1021 W/cm2."",16,12,121301,,Irradiation"; Laser beam quality; Acceleration; Optics; Physics; Planar; Beam (structure); Instability; Laser; Radiation pressure,,,,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/stable-laser-produced-quasimonoenergetic-proton-beams-from-intera https://strathprints.strath.ac.uk/49207/,10.1103/physrevstab.16.121301,;;;;;;;
Low-Level Laser Therapy Enhances Wound Healing in Diabetic Rats: A Comparison of Different Lasers,2007,journal article,Photomedicine and Laser Surgery,Mary Ann Liebert Inc.,Farouk A.H. Al-Watban; Xing Yang Zhang;" Bernard L. Andres,""Objective: The effects of wound healing acceleration on diabetic rats were determined and compared using different laser wavelengths and incident doses. Background Data: Many studies have demonstrated that low-level laser therapy (LLLT) can promote the wound healing on non-diabetic animals. Methods: Male Sprague-Dawley rats were used. Streptozotocin (70 mg/kg) was applied for diabetes induction. An oval full-thickness skin wound was created aseptically with a scalpel in 51 diabetic rats and six non-diabetic rats on the shaved back of the animals. The study was performed using 532, 633, 810, and 980 nm diode lasers. Incident doses of 5, 10, 20, and 30 J/cm2 and treatment schedule of 3 times/week were used in the experiments. The area of wound on all rats was measured and plotted on a slope chart. The slope values (mm2/day), the percentage of relative wound healing, and the percentage of wound healing acceleration were computed in the study. Results: Mean slope values were 6.0871 in non-diabetic control and..."",25,2,72,77,Surgery"; Low level laser therapy; Streptozotocin; Wound healing; Treatment Schedule; Laser therapy; Laser; Diabetes mellitus;" Medicine,,""Animals"; Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental; Low-Level Light Therapy; Male; Radiotherapy Dosage; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley;" Wound Healing/radiation effects"",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17508840 https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/pho.2006.1094,10.1089/pho.2006.1094,";;;;

Modeling Laser Travel and its Effects on Temperature Evolution in Laser Hardening of Hypoeutectoid Steel,2014,conference proceedings article,Volume 1A: 34th Computers and Information in Engineering Conference,American Society of Mechanical Engineers,Suhash Ghosh;" Chittaranjan Sahay,""To achieve a precise and controlled laser process, a thorough analysis of the thermal behavior of the material is necessary. The knowledge of the thermal cycles is important to ascertain suitable processing parameters, thus improving surface properties when the alloys are laser irradiated. In the present paper, a numerical simulation of the laser hardening process has been developed using the finite element (FE) code ABAQUS™ to solve the heat transfer equation inside the treated material (AISI 4140 steel). The thermal analysis is based on Jaeger’s classical moving heat source method by considering the laser beam as a moving plane (band/disc) heat source and the target material is a semi-infinite solid. However, the FE model, used to solve the governing equation, does not directly accommodate the moving nature of heat source. A reasonable approximation is to divide the laser travel on the substrate into many small time/load steps, and apply variable flux and boundary conditions in each time/load step. This approximates the quasi-steady state phenomena over the series of these time steps for the complete laser travel. This paper investigates the effects of the choice of time/load steps on the temperature evolution as well the computing times in the process.© 2014 ASME"",,,,,Thermal analysis"; Finite element method; Boundary value problem; Materials science; Thermal; Hardening (computing); Computer simulation; Heat transfer; Laser; Mechanical engineering,,,,https://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/IDETC-CIE/proceedings/IDETC-CIE2014/46285/V01AT02A038/256539 http://proceedings.asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/proceeding.aspx?articleid=2090390 https://proceedings.asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/proceeding.aspx?articleid=2090390,10.1115/detc2014-35136,;;;;;;;;;;;

Yakovleva,""The wide use of the laser and light therapy allows to accumulate the huge practical material on application of the low-level electromagnetic field effect in various medicine spheres. We are going to clarify the prima facie seeming contradictory experimental observations as most of them may be explained by the field model, which treats the registered effects as a field disturbance of human organism in a low level electromagnetic radiation of optic band that is an alteration of its inner structure on cell, sub-cell and organ levels. The current investigations show that refraction index and scattering properties of biological liquid and tissue are changing in a low level laser field due to the alteration of their structure state. The field model of the low-level optical radiation effect on a human organism is presented. In vivo and in vitro experimental results confirm this approach. Thus, the field effect mechanism is the main one that is responsible for the alteration of the bioliquid structure and the positive effect of the laser and light therapy treating"",2,,1,1,Optical radiation"; Optics; Physics; Electromagnetic radiation; Scattering; Electromagnetic field; Field effect; Refractive index; Laser; SPHERES,,,,http://yadda.icm.edu.pl/yadda/element/bwmeta1.element.ieee-000001251238,10.1109/caol.2003.1251238,;;;;;;;;;;;

Improvement of wear resistance of a laser-sprayed Ti-N coating by laser remelting,1998,journal article,Welding International,Taylor and Francis Ltd.,S Nishimori; K Wakatake; Minoru Nishida; T Araki,Summary It has been recently reported that porous Ti-N sprayed coatings can be made fine-structured by laser irradiation. This paper describes an investigation of the effects of infiltrated metal species on the wear resistance of Ti-N remelted layers. Non-ferrous metal powders were sprayed on SS400 steel plate substrates in an argon atmosphere. The coating thickness was around 200 μm. Pure titanium was also sprayed on the non-ferrous sprayed coatings in a nitrogen atmosphere. The coating thickness was around 400 μm. Coating specimens consisting of non-ferrous and Ti-N layers were remelted by laser in a nitrogen atmosphere. The remelted layers of the coatings had a fine microstructure with a hardness value above HV1000. The wear resistance of the Ti-N coatings was appreciably improved by remelting.,12,8,635,641,Inertial confinement fusion; Irradiation; Composite material; Metallurgy; Materials science; Titanium nitride; Coating; Titanium; Laser; Porosity; Microstructure,,,,http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09507119809452026 http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&cpsidt=2351138,10.1080/09507119809452026,;;;;;;;;

"Strain Measurement by Laser-Speckle,1986,book chapter,Photoelasticity,Springer Japan,Ichirou Yamaguchi,""A laser-speckle pattern is a random granular pattern which arises in the light scattered from a laser-illuminated rough surface or in its image. It results from random interference of the light scattered from various surface points and can be used as distinct random marks attached to the surface. Applications of speckle to deformation measurements are especially useful because they are complementary to holographic interferometry in many respects (Ennos 1978";" Yamaguchi 1985). In general, speckle methods are simpler in set-up and more suitable for measuring in-plane deformation that is difficult to determine by holographic interferometry."",,,65,72,Speckle pattern"; Optics; Physics; Holographic interferometry; Interference (wave propagation); Strain measurement; Deformation (mechanics); Strain gauge; Speckle imaging,,,,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-4-431-68039-0_9 https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-4-431-68039-0_9,10.1007/978-4-431-68039-0_9,;;;;;;;;;;;;
