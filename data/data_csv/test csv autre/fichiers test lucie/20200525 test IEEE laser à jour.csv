The FBGs are inscribed in an erbium/ytterbium co-doped fiber using the direct-write, plane-by-plane femtosecond laser inscription method, which allows for complete spatial control of the refractive index change in the fiber core. This approach offers a significant advantage, as we eliminate the fiber splices typically required between the active and passive fibers that would, otherwise, incorporate the FBG. The gratings were characterized in transmission and reflection, and the performance of the fiber laser was recorded when the fiber was coiled into a circular and kidney shape. The kidney shape of the fiber coil improved the laser slope efficiency, as the inner cladding of the active fiber had a circular shape.

This system acquires both confocal reflectance and Doppler signals in a confocal architecture to image dynamic turbid media with higher contrast than a system operating in either modality and is coherent in nature. In a confocal optical configuration, reflectance confocal microscopy provides information about scattering from within a small volume centered around the focal point of the confocal system, and laser Doppler flowmetry provides information about the velocity of moving scatterers within the same volume. Raster scanning the sample enables the concurrent creation of two images, containing independent information, from a well-specified depth within the sample. Concurrent spatial mapping of these independent sensing modalities affords improvement in the capability of the imaging system by obtaining additional information from both morphological and functional features of the dynamic turbid medium at depths penetrable by near-infrared lasers. We realize the idea using a laser feedback interferometry imaging system scanning a microfluidic channel that contains a dynamic turbid medium.

In order to overcome the bottleneck that the optical frequency shift signal with a wide frequency offset from near zero can hardly be obtained using traditional electro-optic or acousto-optic frequency shifting, the frequency of laser signal is first moved to a lower/higher fixed frequency and then shifted back to a higher/lower tunable frequency. The signal after cascaded frequency shifting in the opposite direction is equivalent to the original laser signal with DFS. In the experiment, the value and direction of DFS correspond to the magnitude and sign of the difference between the two frequency shifts. The DFS from -14 GHz to +14 GHz with a varying rate of 323 MHz/s is accurately implemented. In addition, the side mode suppression ratio (SMSR) of laser signals with DFS are all over 52.3 dB.

This issue also complicates the fabrication and characterization of the highly demanded light sources for optical interconnects and transmission. It is desired to optimize the device structure to make EMLs robust and immune to residual facet reflection. EMLs with a partially corrugated-grating DFB section are designed and optimized to have much improved tolerance to the residual optical reflection from the modulator output facet. By designing the laser section with an appropriate grating length and linear gain coefficient, the EML can have good tolerance to residual facet reflection. The analysis indicates that 100% yield can be obtained with the optimal design.

This limitation can be overcome by using a laser-induced forward transfer (DLIFT) approach. In this work, SEs formed by DLIFT and LD are compared to a homogenous tube diffusion (Diff) emitter. We investigated the correlation of the emitter saturation current density (j0e) and the specific contact resistance (?c) with the sheet resistance (Rsheet) and the laser pulse energy density (Ep,d). For passivated emitters, j0e of DLIFT and LD emitters was around ten times higher than j0e of Diff emitters. For metallized emitters, simulated j0e of DLIFT emitters was lower than j0e of LD and Diff emitters for Rsheet glt; 40.0 ?/sq. Moreover, we show how j0e can be further reduced by increasing the surface dopant concentration of the boron emitter and by reducing the laser-induced defects in the silicon crystal. Additionally, the metallization of DLIFT emitters with aluminum-silver paste by screen printing provided low contact resistances between metal and silicon (?c <; 1.0 m? · cm2).

The charging current of the barrier capacitance determines the condition for an LT to pass to the uncontrollable turn-on mode. The holding current determines the condition for the transition of an LT to the sticking mode in the turned-on state.

Research suggests conventional electrical interconnects will be inadequate to support large-scale many-core processors. Thus, emerging technologies such as on-chip silicon nanophotonics may help meet the demands of future many-core processors by providing high-bandwidth and low-power communication over extended distances. Nanophotonic interconnects require a large external laser source which is often wasted during periods of low network utilization.

Efficient parametric conversion was realized with a maximum average power output of 7.3 W at 3.8 ?m under pump power of 45 W at 1.064 ?m with pump-to-idler conversion efficiency exceeding 16%.;1943-0655;10.1109/JPHOT.2016.2564445;"National Natural Science Foundation of China; Research Fund of Zhejiang Provincial Science and Technology Department; Scientific Research Fund of Zhejiang Provincial Education Department; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; ";https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.gaelnomade-1.grenet.fr/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7468517;"Optical fiber lasers;optical parametric oscillators (OPOs);periodically poled magnesium-oxide-doped lithium niobate (PPMgLN);quasi-synchronously pumping;Optical fiber lasers;optical parametric oscillators (OPOs);periodically poled magnesium-oxide-doped lithium niobate (PPMgLN);quasi-synchronously pumping";"Optical fiber amplifiers;Optical fiber polarization;Optical fiber couplers;Laser excitation;Power amplifiers;Power generation";"chirp modulation;distributed Bragg reflector lasers;fibre lasers;lithium compounds;magnesium compounds;optical fibre couplers;optical parametric oscillators;optical pulse generation;optical pumping;semiconductor lasers;ytterbium";"pump-to-idler conversion efficiency;periodically poled magnesium-oxide-doped lithium niobate;linearly polarized fiber laser;fiber-pigtailed acousto-optic modulator;PRR;MOPA;master oscillator power amplifier;pulse repetition rate;gain switching;distributed Bragg reflector laser diode;optical parametric oscillator;midinfrared laser generation;picosecond bursts;quasisynchronous pump;high power Yb fiber laser;frequency 138 MHz;power 7.3 W;wavelength 3.8 mum;power 45 W;wavelength 1.064 mum;LiNbO3:MgO";;3;;21;;IEEE;IEEE Journals

In the experimental system, the temperature variation of the laser cavity can be extracted from tracking the undistorted waveforms of the superimposed multi-longitudinal mode laser self-mixing vibration sensing signal that are highly susceptible to the compensating length of the external cavity. The temperature measurement resolution of the laser cavity temperature monitoring system is 0.253 K, which corresponds to 39.49 ?m/K of the external cavity sensitivity. It has also been shown that the experimental results are well consistent with the measurement of using the thermal imaging camera.;1558-1748;10.1109/JSEN.2019.2899115;"National Natural Science Foundation of China; Foundation for Scientific Research and Technical Leaders in Anhui Province; Natural Science Foundation of University of Anhui Province; Anhui University; ";https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.gaelnomade-1.grenet.fr/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8641380;"Self-mixing;laser sensor;multi-longitudinal mode;temperature measurement;laser cavity";"Cavity resonators;Laser modes;Temperature measurement;Measurement by laser beam;Temperature sensors;Vibrations";"laser cavity resonators;laser feedback;laser modes;laser variables measurement;semiconductor lasers;temperature measurement;vibration measurement";"temperature variation;temperature measurement resolution;laser cavity temperature monitoring system;external cavity sensitivity;self-mixing vibration sensing signal;superimposed multilongitudinal mode laser self-mixing effect;undistorted waveforms";;;;32;;IEEE;IEEE Journals

Laser-triggered vacuum switch combines laser technology, vacuum switch technology, and three-electrode trigger switch technology, and has the advantages of heavy current capability, good isolation from the main circuit, and short delay time. In this paper, the 1-D thermal conduction model was developed to analyze the influence of laser energy on the velocity of initial plasma.
