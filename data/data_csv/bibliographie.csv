Certain anthropogenic soils, with a low fertility level and often contaminated, ended up underused and derelict. Although derelict for humans, these soils may be refuges for biodiversity, but their biological functioning remains poorly understood. To this end, a trait-based approach of soil invertebrate communities might be an effective predictor of ecosystem state. The present work aims to highlight the in situ links between the abiotic characteristics of derelict soils and the taxonomic and functional structure and composition (through a trait-based approach) of macrofauna and Collembola communities inhabiting these soils. We studied 6 different derelict soils: two soils from coking plants, one soil from a settling pond, two constructed soils, and an inert waste storage soil. We measured fifteen abiotic soil parameters that inform on fertility and contamination. We took into account sixteen traits and ecological preferences to characterize the functional structure and composition of Collembola and macrofauna communities. Soil fertility (organic matter content, C:N ratio, P, Ca and Mg concentrations, cation-exchange capacity, and clay content) and moderate contamination (Pb, Cd, Zn, and PAH concentrations) altered the taxonomic and functional composition of Collembola and macrofauna communities by selecting traits such as body length, pigmentation, vertical distribution, diet type, and habitat preference. Compost-amended constructed soil properties selected taxonomic and functional community composition of slightly disturbed soil. In contrast, metal-contaminated constructed soil harbored a higher proportion of Collembola displaying the traits and ecological preferences of instable ecosystems. The study of functional profiles of Collembola and macrofauna communities in the derelict soils evidenced that they support different communities with more or less wide functional potential. It underlines the interest of multiple biotic component studies to reach a better ecosystem description.;"[Vincent, Quentin; Leyval, Corinne; Beguiristain, Thierry] Univ Lorraine, LIEC, CNRS, F-54000 Nancy, France; [Vincent, Quentin; Auclerc, Apolline] Univ Lorraine, LSE, INRA, F-54000 Nancy, France";France;FRA;Auclerc, A (reprint author), Univ Lorraine, LSE, INRA, F-54000 Nancy, France.;apolline.auclerc@univ-lorraine.fr;;AUCLERC, Apolline/0000-0003-2172-2750;"French Lorraine RegionRegion Grand-Est; European Regional Development Fund (ERDF)European Union (EU)";This work was carried out within the GISFI (Groupement d'interet scientifique sur les friches industrielles, www.gisfi.fr), within the framework of the LORVER project (www.lorver.org).

However, little is known about their interactions when they are simultaneously colonizing a plant root, especially in trace element (TE)-polluted soils. We therefore investigated the effects of Cadophora sp. and Funneliformis mosseae on ryegrass (Lolium perenne) growth and element uptake in a Cd/Zn/Pb-polluted soil. The experiment included four treatments, i.e., inoculation with Cadophora sp., inoculation with F. mosseae, co-inoculation with Cadophora sp. and F. mosseae, and no inoculation. Ryegrass biomass and shoot Na, P, K, and Mg concentrations significantly increased following AMF inoculation as compared to non-inoculated controls. Similarly, DSE inoculation increased shoot Na concentration, whereas dual inoculation significantly decreased shoot Cd concentration. Moreover, oxidative stress determined by ryegrass leaf malondialdehyde concentration was alleviated both in the AMF and dual inoculation treatments. We used quantitative PCR and microscope observations to quantify colonization rates. They demonstrated that DSEs had no effect on AMF colonization, while AMF colonization slightly decreased DSE frequency. We also monitored fluorescein diacetate (FDA) hydrolysis and alkaline phosphatase (AP) activity in the rhizosphere soils. FDA hydrolysis remained unchanged in the three inoculated treatments, but AMF colonization increased AP activity and P mobility in the soil whereas DSE colonization did not alter AP activity. In this experiment, we unveiled the interactions between two ecologically important fungal groups likely to occur in roots which involved a decrease of oxidative stress and Cd accumulation in shoots. These results open promising perspectives on the fungal-based phytomanagement of TE-contaminated sites by the production of uncontaminated and marketable plant biomass.;"[Berthelot, Charlotte; Blaudez, Damien; Beguiristain, Thierry; Leyval, Corinne] Univ Lorraine, CNRS, LIEC, F-54000 Nancy, France; [Chalot, Michel] Univ Bourgogne Franche Comte, Pole Univ Pays Montbeliard, CNRS, Lab Chronoenvironm, F-25211 Montbeliard, France; [Chalot, Michel] Univ Lorraine, F-54000 Nancy, France";France;FRA;Leyval, C (reprint author), Univ Lorraine, CNRS, LIEC, F-54000 Nancy, France.;corinne.leyval@univ-lorraine.fr;CHALOT, Michel/A-1113-2012;"CHALOT, Michel/0000-0001-8614-0917; Blaudez, Damien/0000-0003-3287-3482";"LORVER project - Lorraine RegionRegion Grand-Est; European Regional Development Fund (ERDF)European Union (EU); Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR) under the Blanc InternationalFrench National Research Agency (ANR) [ANR-10-INTB-1703-01-BIOFILTREE]";This work was supported by the LORVER project (www.lorver.org) funded by the Lorraine Region and the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), and by the Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR) under the Blanc International ANR-10-INTB-1703-01-BIOFILTREE project.

Derelict soils have low fertility, can be contaminated, and many of them remain unused. However, with the increasing demand of soil surfaces, they might be considered as a resource, for example for non-food biomass production. The study of their physico-chemical properties and of their biodiversity and biological activity may provide indications for their potential re-use. The objective of our study was to investigate the quality of six derelict soils, considering abiotic, biotic, and functional parameters. We studied (i) the soil bacteria, fungi, meso- and macro-fauna and plant communities of six different derelict soils (two from coking plants, one from a settling pond, two constructed ones made from different substrates and remediated soil, and an inert waste storage one), and (ii) their decomposition function based on the decomposer trophic network, enzyme activities, mineralization activity, and organic pollutant degradation. Biodiversity levels in these soils were high, but all biotic parameters, except the mycorrhizal colonization level, discriminated them. Multivariate analysis showed that biotic parameters co-varied more with fertility proxies than with soil contamination parameters. Similarly, functional parameters significantly co-varied with abiotic parameters. Among functional parameters, macro-decomposer proportion, enzyme activity, average mineralization capacity, and microbial polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon degraders were useful to discriminate the soils. We assessed their quality by combining abiotic, biotic, and functional parameters: the compost-amended constructed soil displayed the highest quality, while the settling pond soil and the contaminated constructed soil displayed the lowest. Although differences among the soils were highlighted, this study shows that derelict soils may provide a biodiversity ecosystem service and are functional for decomposition. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Although the communities may be well adapted to the presence of stressors, knowledge about microbial diversity in such soils is scarce. Soil microbial community dynamics can be driven by the presence of plants, but the impact of plant development on selection or diversification of microorganisms in these soils has not been established yet. To test these hypotheses, aged-contaminated soil samples from a field trial were collected. Plots planted with alfalfa were compared to bare soil plots, and bacterial and fungal diversity and abundance were assessed after 2 and 6 years. Using pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA gene and ITS amplicons, we showed that the bacterial community was dominated by Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Bacteroidetes and was characterized by low Acidobacteria abundance, while the fungal community was mainly represented by members of the Ascomycota. The short-term toxic impact of pollutants usually reduces the microbial diversity, yet in our samples bacterial and fungal species richness and diversity was high suggesting that the community structure and diversity adapted to the contaminated soil over decades. The presence of plants induced higher bacterial and fungal diversity than in bare soil. It also increased the relative abundance of bacterial members of the Actinomycetales, Rhizobiales, and Xanthomonadales orders and of most fungal orders. Multivariate analysis showed correlations between microbial community structure and heavy metal and PAH concentrations over time, but also with edaphic parameters (C/N, pH, phosphorus, and nitrogen concentrations).;"[Bourceret, Amelia; Cebron, Aurelie; Beguiristain, Thierry; Leyval, Corinne] CNRS, Fac Sci & Technol, CNRS, LIEC UMR7360, BP70239, F-54506 Vandoeuvre Les Nancy, France; [Bourceret, Amelia; Cebron, Aurelie; Beguiristain, Thierry; Leyval, Corinne] Univ Lorraine, LIEC UMR7360, Fac Sci & Technol, BP 70239, F-54506 Vandoeuvre Les Nancy, France; [Tisserant, Emilie] INRA, IAM UMR 1136, Ctr INRA Nancy, F-54280 Seichamps, France; [Poupin, Pascal; Bauda, Pascale] Univ Lorraine, LIEC UMR 7360, Campus Bridoux Rue Gen Delestraint, F-57070 Metz, France; [Poupin, Pascal; Bauda, Pascale] CNRS, LIEC UMR7360, Campus Bridoux Rue Gen Delestraint, F-57070 Metz, France";France;FRA;"Cebron, A (reprint author), CNRS, Fac Sci & Technol, CNRS, LIEC UMR7360, BP70239, F-54506 Vandoeuvre Les Nancy, France.; Cebron, A (reprint author), Univ Lorraine, LIEC UMR7360, Fac Sci & Technol, BP 70239, F-54506 Vandoeuvre Les Nancy, France.";aurelie.cebron@univ-lorraine.fr;;;"OTELo (Observatoire Terre et Environnement de Lorraine); Agence Nationale de la RechercheFrench National Research Agency (ANR) [ANR-2008-CESA-010, ANR-13-JSV7-0007_01]";This study was funded by OTELo (Observatoire Terre et Environnement de Lorraine) and the Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR-2008-CESA-010 and ANR-13-JSV7-0007_01).

In such soils, the microbial community is well adapted to the pollution, but the microbial activity is limited by nutrient availability. Management strategies could be applied to modify the soil microbial functioning as well as the PAH contamination through various amendment types. The impact of amendment with clay minerals (montmorillonite), wood sawdust and organic matter plant roots on microbial community structure was investigated on two aged PAH-contaminated soils both in laboratory and 1-year on-site pot experiments. Total PAH content (sum of 16 PAHs of the US-EPA list) and polar polycyclic aromatic compounds (pPAC) were monitored as well as the available PAH fraction using the Tenax method. The bacterial and fungal community structures were monitored using fingerprinting thermal gradient gel electrophoresis (TTGE) method. The abundance of bacteria (16S rRNA genes), fungi (18S rRNA genes) and PAH degraders (PAH-ring hydroxylating dioxygenase and catechol dioxygenase genes) was followed through qPCR assays. Although the treatments did not modify the total and available PAH content, the microbial community density, structure and the PAH degradation potential changed when fresh organic matter was provided as sawdust and under rhizosphere influence, while the clay mineral only increased the percentage of catechol-1,2-dioxygenase genes. The abundance of bacteria and fungi and the percentage of fungi relative to bacteria were enhanced in soil samples supplemented with wood sawdust and in the plant rhizospheric soils. Two distinct fungal populations developed in the two soils supplemented with sawdust, i.e. fungi related to Chaetomium and Neurospora genera and Brachyconidiellopsis and Pseudallescheria genera, in H and NM soils respectively. Wood sawdust amendment favoured the development of PAH-degrading bacteria holding Gram-negative PAH-ring hydroxylating dioxygenase, catechol-1,2-dioxygenase and catechol-2,3-dioxygenase genes. Regarding the total community structure, bacteria closely related to Thiobacillus (beta-Proteobacteria) and Steroidobacter (gamma-Proteobacteria) genera were favoured by wood sawdust amendment. In both soils, plant rhizospheres induced the development of fungi belonging to Ascomycota and related to Alternaria and Fusarium genera. Bacteria closely related to Luteolibacter (Verrucomicrobia) and Microbacterium (Actinobacteria) were favoured in alfalfa and ryegrass rhizosphere.;"[Cebron, Aurelie; Beguiristain, Thierry; Bongoua-Devisme, Jeanne; Faure, Pierre; Leyval, Corinne] CNRS, LIEC UMR 7360, Fac Sci & Technol, F-54506 Vandoeuvre Les Nancy, France; [Cebron, Aurelie; Beguiristain, Thierry; Bongoua-Devisme, Jeanne; Faure, Pierre; Leyval, Corinne] Univ Lorraine, LIEC UMR 7360, Fac Sci & Technol, F-54506 Vandoeuvre Les Nancy, France; [Denonfoux, Jeremie; Parisot, Nicolas; Peyret, Pierre] Univ Auvergne, Clermont Univ, EA CIDAM 4678, F-63001 Clermont Ferrand, France; [Lorgeoux, Catherine] CNRS, GeoRessources UMR 7359, Fac Sci & Technol, F-54506 Vandoeuvre Les Nancy, France; [Ouvrard, Stephanie] INRA, LSE UMR 1120, F-54518 Vandoeuvre Les Nancy, France; [Ouvrard, Stephanie] Univ Lorraine, LSE UMR 1120, F-54518 Vandoeuvre Les Nancy, France";France;FRA;Cebron, A (reprint author), Univ Lorraine, LIEC UMR 7360, Fac Sci & Technol, BP 70239, F-54506 Vandoeuvre Les Nancy, France.;aurelie.cebron@univ-lorraine.fr;"Ouvrard, Stephanie/J-9353-2012; Parisot, Nicolas/C-8116-2012";"Ouvrard, Stephanie/0000-0002-3190-0410; Parisot, Nicolas/0000-0001-5217-8415; PEYRET, Pierre/0000-0003-3114-0586";"EC2CO-MicrobiEN program (INSU-CNRS); program Investissements d'avenir AMI VALTEXFrench National Research Agency (ANR)";This study was funded by the EC2CO-MicrobiEN program (INSU-CNRS) and the program Investissements d'avenir AMI 2011 VALTEX.

We investigated their interactions and their effect on the dissipation of three PAHs-phenanthrene (PHE), pyrene (PYR) and dibenz(a,h)anthracene (DBA)-in planted microcosms, in sterile sand or non-sterile soil. In sterile sand microcosms planted with alfalfa, the two microbes survived and grew, without any significant effect of co-inoculation. Co-inoculation led to the dissipation of 46 % of PHE after 21 days. In soil microcosms, whether planted with alfalfa or not, both strains persisted throughout the 46 days of the experiment, without any effect of co-inoculation or of alfalfa, as assessed by real-time PCR targeting taxon-level indicators, i.e. Actinobacteria 16S rDNA and the intergenic transcribed spacer specific to the genus Fusarium. The microbial community was analyzed by temporal temperature gradient electrophoresis and real-time PCR targeting bacterial and fungal rDNA and PAH-ring hydroxylating dioxygenase genes. These communities were modified by PAH pollution, which selected PAH-degrading bacteria, by the presence of alfalfa and, concerning the bacterial community, by inoculation. PHE and PYR concentrations significantly decreased (91 and 46 %, respectively) whatever the treatment, but DBA concentration significantly decreased (30 %) in planted and co-inoculated microcosms only.;"[Thion, Cecile; Cebron, Aurelie; Beguiristain, Thierry; Leyval, Corinne] Univ Lorraine, CNRS, LIMOS, UMR 7137, F-54506 Vandoeuvre Les Nancy, France";France;FRA;Leyval, C (reprint author), Univ Lorraine, CNRS, LIMOS, UMR 7137, BP 70239, F-54506 Vandoeuvre Les Nancy, France.;corinne.leyval@limos.uhp-nancy.fr;;;"ANR program (MULTIPOLSITE)French National Research Agency (ANR) [ANR-2008-CESA-010]; GISFI (Groupement d'Interet Scientifique sur les Friches Industrielles)";The authors gratefully acknowledge the ANR program (MULTIPOLSITE, ANR-2008-CESA-010) and GISFI (Groupement d'Interet Scientifique sur les Friches Industrielles, www.gisfi.fr) for financial support.;;51;24;26;2;94;SPRINGER;NEW YORK;233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA;0923-9820;1572-9729;;BIODEGRADATION;Biodegradation;JUL;2013;24;4;;;SI;;569;581;;10.1007/s10532-013-9628-3;;;13;Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology;Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology;155QI;WOS:000319762600011;23543362;;;;2020-02-11

However, sentinel soil-dwelling invertebrates can be used for such an assessment. This study aims to establish the modulating soil parameter of metal bioavailability to snails and a procedure for ranking field sites (n = 9; 43 plots) based on the evaluation of the transfer of metals to the land snails used as indicators of metal zooavailability. Multivariate regressions identify soil pH, organic carbon and iron oxides influence cadmium, chromium, copper, lead and zinc zooavailability to snails underlining the need to consider other parameter than total soil concentration during bioavailability assessment. However, for As, no influence of soil parameter on it bioavailability to snails was identified. Internal Concentrations of Reference (CIRef) of Cd, Pb, As, Cr, Cu and Zn were determined in Cantareus aspersus that were caged on unpolluted plots. CIRef allow for the identification of contaminated sites. CIRef have revealed unexpected metal transfer on some ""unpolluted"" sites and a lack of transfer on some contaminated sites, thus confirming the necessity for biological measures to evaluate metal mobility. The Sum of Excess of Transfers (SET) index ranked the industrially impacted sites as the top priorities for management. We recommend that the SET methodology be used for future environmental risk assessment.

To evaluate the effects of biodegradation on the organic matter and the main organic constituents (coal and coal tar) of a coking plant soil, we conducted a batch incubation experiment, whereby mineral nutrient solution and a microbial inoculum from the coking plant soil were added to the different samples. Microbial counts were monitored during the 9 months of the biodegradation experiment and the mineralization rate was quantified by measuring the CO2 produced and the content, molecular weight (MW) distribution and molecular composition of the solvent extractable organic matter. The microbial enumeration and mineralization rate demonstrated no biodegradation with the coal tar but biodegradation was observed for the coal and coking plant soil samples. The coking plant soil exhibited the highest biodegradation rate, probably due to complex interactions between the different organic and mineral phases and the presence of various nutrient and carbon sources. Biodegradation of the kerogen with subsequent production of lower MW compounds (n-alkanes and isoprenoids) was observed for both coal and coking plant soil samples. The results indicate that the kerogen could be a potential source of carbon for the microorganisms and showed the central role of coal in the changes observed for the coking plant soil.

A pot experiment was conducted in which PAHs extracted from soil and plant, quantity of PAH degraders, and plant biomass were evaluated. The results showed that biodegradation was the dominant removal mechanism for PAHs from soil while PAH accumulation in the plant tissue was negligible. PAH dissipation varied with the plant species and decreased with the increase of PAH molecular weight. The four plant species displayed a positive effect on PHE dissipation, and alfalfa improved PYR and DBA dissipation. AM fungi significantly increased plant biomass, phosphorus uptake, and PHE removal rate in planted treatments. Plant biomass and PAH degraders showed a weak linear relationship with PAH dissipation, indicating that there might be other important factors influencing PAH dissipation.;"[Zhou, Xiaobai; Zhou, Jiti; Xiang, Xuemin] Dalian Univ Technol, Sch Environm Sci & Technol, Dalian 116024, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Xiaobai; Cebron, Aurelie; Beguiristain, Thierry; Leyval, Corinne] Nancy Univ, CNRS, LIMOS, F-54506 Vandoeuvre Les Nancy, France";"France; Chine";"FRA; CHN";Zhou, XB (reprint author), Dalian Univ Technol, Sch Environm Sci & Technol, Linggong Rd, Dalian 116024, Peoples R China.;dianadeweyzp@163.com;;;Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of ChinaMinistry of Science and Technology, China [2012ZX07202-006];Financial contribution to this paper was provided by the Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China (No. 2012ZX07202-006).;;40;11;13;0;26;HARD;OLSZTYN 5;POST-OFFICE BOX, 10-718 OLSZTYN 5, POLAND;1230-1485;;;POL J ENVIRON STUD;Pol.

Three treatments were monitored: bare soil (NM-BS), soil planted with alfalfa and inoculated with mycorrhizal fungi (NM-Msm), and soil with spontaneous vegetation (NM-SV). The same soil after thermal desorption (TD) was planted with alfalfa and inoculated with mycorrhizal fungi (TD-Msm). Twice a year for 5 years, the fungal abundance and the community structure were evaluated by real-time PCR and temporal temperature gradient gel electrophoresis targeting 18S rRNA genes. The fungal abundance increased over time and was higher in planted than in bare NM soil and in TD than in NM soil. The Shannon diversity index (H') increased during the first 2 years with the emergence of more than 30 ribotypes, but decreased after 3 years with the selection of a few competitive species, mostly Ascomycetes. H' was higher under complex plant assemblage (NM-SV) than in the NM-BS plots but did not differ between NM and TD soils planted with alfalfa. These results indicated that even in a highly polluted soil, the plant cover was the main driver of the fungal community structure.;"[Thion, Cecile; Cebron, Aurelie; Beguiristain, Thierry; Leyval, Corinne] Lorraine Univ, Fac Sci, CNRS, LIMOS,UMR 7137, F-54506 Vandoeuvre Les Nancy, France";France;FRA;Cebron, A (reprint author), Lorraine Univ, Fac Sci, CNRS, LIMOS,UMR 7137, BP 70239, F-54506 Vandoeuvre Les Nancy, France.;aurelie.cebron@univ-lorraine.fr;;;"ANR program (MULTIPOLSITE)French National Research Agency (ANR) [ANR-2008-CESA-010]; INSU-EC2CO-MicrobiEn";We gratefully acknowledge the GISFI (Groupement d'Interet Scientifique sur les Friches Industrielles, www.gisfi.fr) for providing field site equipment, the ANR program (MULTIPOLSITE, ANR-2008-CESA-010) and INSU-EC2CO-MicrobiEn for financial support.;;63;30;30;0;69;OXFORD UNIV PRESS;OXFORD;GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND;0168-6496;1574-6941;;FEMS MICROBIOL ECOL;FEMS Microbiol.

Soil samples were collected from two sites: one invaded by the exotic plant. Amaranthus viridis, and one uninvaded site for chemical and AM propagules density analyses. Additionally, we grew five Sahelian Acacia species in soil from the two sites, sterilized or not, to test the involvement of soil biota in the invasion process. While nutrient availability was significantly higher in soil samples from the invaded sites, a drastic reduction in AM fungal community density, was observed. Moreover, Acacia seedlings' growth was severely reduced in soils invaded by Amaranthus and this effect was similar to that of sterilized soil of both origins. The observed growth inhibition was accompanied by reduction of AM colonization and nodulation of the roots. Finally, the influence of soil chemistry and AM symbiosis on exotic plants' invasion processes is discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The contributions of adsorption, absorption and biotransformation were evaluated separately by extracting and analysing PAHs from the biomass and from the culture medium. In the pure culture, E solani dissipated approximately 30% of each tested PAM in 28 days when glucose was supplied as the carbon source. PAH adsorption on E solani hyphae was negligible, whereas absorption was found to account for one-third of the dissipation. Absorbed PAHs, reaching 3% of the fungal dry biomass, could be visualised in autofluorescent intracellular vesicles. In contrast, A. oxydans grew on PAHs as sole carbon source and led to 55% dissipation of PHE in 28 days without any significant absorption. This dissipation potential was inhibited by the presence of glucose, and the PYR and DBA contents were never dissipated in the bacterial pure culture. In the mixed co-culture, the PAM dissipation rates were lower, showing that antagonistic interactions, such as pH changes or competition for carbon source, indirectly inhibited both microbial potentials.

Multipolluted soils are therefore a key concern for remediation. This work presents a long-term evaluation of the fate and environmental impact of the organic and metallic contaminants of an industrially polluted soil under natural and plant-assisted conditions. A field trial was followed for four years according to six treatments in four replicates: unplanted, planted with alfalfa with or without mycorrhizal inoculation, planted with Noccaea caerulescens, naturally colonized by indigenous plants, and thermally treated soil planted with alfalfa. Leaching water volumes and composition, PAH concentrations in soil and solutions, soil fauna and microbial diversity, soil and solution toxicity using standardized bioassays, plant biomass, mycorrhizal colonization, were monitored. Results showed that plant cover alone did not affect total contaminant concentrations in soil. However, it was most efficient in improving the contamination impact on the environment and in increasing the biological diversity. Leaching water quality remained an issue because of its high toxicity shown by micro-algae testing. In this matter, prior treatment of the soil by thermal desorption proved to be the only effective treatment.;"[Ouvrard, S.; Barnier, C.; Cortet, J.; Morel, J.

The present study proposes some study objectives for bioindicator approaches, based on the earthwormn results from the programme. Therefore, different earthworm descriptors were tested at the community level (e.g. abundance, biomass, species and functional structures, and ecological traits) as well as the organism level (i.e. measuring the metallothionein coding gene expression level in earthworms). The present results, obtained from the programme's spring 2009 sampling campaign, discriminated among the different descriptors and showed that earthworm and endogeic abundance as well as the individual weight of endogeics seem to be good indicators in non-contaminated (cultivated) sites, while the ecological structure, namely the proportion of anecic vs. endogeic species, and the proportion of non-vulnerable species should be used as indicators of contaminated soils. Furthermore, the first results obtained for Lumbricus terrestris and L rubellus rubellus are encouraging as they show that metallothionein expression increases in metal-contaminated soils. The relevance of these descriptors, which have to be considered in study objectives, requires the analysis of 2010 results. (C) 2011 Elsevier GmbH.

This study was conducted in situ for 2 years using experimental plots of the two soils. NM soil was colonized by spontaneous vegetation (NM-SV), planted with Medicago sativa (NM-Ms), or left as bare soil (NM-BS), and the TD soil was planted with Medicago sativa (TD-Ms). The bacterial community density, structure, and diversity were estimated by real-time PCR quantification of the 16S rRNA gene copy number, temporal thermal gradient gel electrophoresis fingerprinting, and band sequencing, respectively. The density of the bacterial community increased the first year during stabilization of the system and stayed constant in the NM soil, while it continued to increase in the TD soil during the second year. The bacterial community structure diverged among all the plot types after 2 years on site. In the NM-BS plots, the bacterial community was represented mainly by Betaproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria. The presence of vegetation (NM-SV and NM-Ms) in the NM soil favored the development of a wider range of bacterial phyla (Alphaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, and Chloroflexi) that, for the most part, were not closely related to known bacterial representatives. Moreover, under the influence of the same plant, the bacterial community that developed in the TD-Ms was represented by different bacterial species (Alphaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, and Actinobacteria) than that in the NM-Ms. During the 2 years of monitoring, the PAH concentration did not evolve significantly. The abundance of gram-negative (GN) and gram-positive (GP) PAH-degrading bacteria was estimated by real-time PCR quantification of specific functional genes encoding the alpha subunit of PAH-ring hydroxylating dioxygenase (PAH-RHD(alpha)). The percentage of the PAH-RHD(alpha) GN bacterial genes relative to 16S rRNA gene density decreased with time in all the plots.

We investigated the effects of the watering regime and phosphorus concentration on PAH dissipation in the rhizosphere of mycorrhizal plants in a pot experiment. Two plant species, alfalfa (Medicago sativa) and tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea), were co-cultured and inoculated with an arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungus (Glomus intraradices) in PAH (phenanthrene (PHE) = 500 mg kg(-1), pyrene (PYR) = 500 mg kg(-1), dibenzo(a,h)anthracene (DBA) = 65 mg kg(-1)) spiked agricultural soil for 6 weeks. Treatments with different phosphor-us concentrations and watering regimes were compared. The PHE dissipation reached 90% in all treatments and was not affected by the treatments. The major finding was the significant positive impact of mycorrhizal plants on the dissipation of high molecular weight PAH (DBA) in high-water low-phosphorus treatment. Such an effect was not observed in high-water high-phosphorus and low-water low-phosphorus treatments, where AM colonization was very low. A positive linear relationship was detected between PYR dissipation and the percentage of Gram-positive PAH-ring hydroxylating dioxygenase genes in high-water high-phosphorus treatments, but not in the other two treatments with lower phosphorus concentrations and water contents. Such results indicated that the phosphorus and water regime were important parameters for the dissipation of HMW-PAH. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.;"[Zhou, X.

The experiment was conducted in Senegal at two sites: one invaded by A. viridis and the other covered by other plant species. Soil nutrient contents as well as microbial community density, diversity and functions were measured. Additionally, five sahelian Acacia species were grown in (1) soil disinfected or not collected from both sites, (2) uninvaded soil exposed to an A. viridis plant aqueous extract and (3) soil collected from invaded and uninvaded sites and inoculated or not with the arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungus Glomus intraradices. The results showed that the invasion of A. viridis increased soil nutrient availability, bacterial abundance and microbial activities. In contrast, AM fungi and rhizobial development and the growth of Acacia species were severely reduced in A. viridis-invaded soil. Amaranthus viridis aqueous extract also exhibited an inhibitory effect on rhizobial growth, indicating an antibacterial activity of this plant extract. However, the inoculation of G. intraradices was highly beneficial to the growth and nodulation of Acacia species. These results highlight the role of AM symbiosis in the processes involved in plant coexistence and in ecosystem management programs that target preservation of native plant diversity.;"[Sanon, Arsene; Ndoye, Ibrahima; Sylla, Samba; Duponnois, Robin] UCAD, Lab Commun Microbiol, IRD, ISRA,Ctr Rech Bel Air, Dakar, Senegal; [Sanon, Arsene; Beguiristain, Thierry; Cebron, Aurelie; Berthelin, Jacques; Leyval, Corinne] UHP, Lab Interact Microorganismes Mineraux Mat Organ S, Fac Sci & Tech, UMR 7137,CNRS, Vandoeuvre Les Nancy, France; [Ndoye, Ibrahima; Sylla, Samba] UCAD, Dept Biol Vegetale, Fac Sci & Tech, Dakar, Senegal; [Duponnois, Robin] UM2, IRD, LSTM,UMR 113, CIRAD,INRA,IRD,SUP,AGRO, Montpellier, France";"France; Senegal";"FRA; SEN";Duponnois, R (reprint author), UCAD, Lab Commun Microbiol, IRD, ISRA,Ctr Rech Bel Air, BP 1386, Dakar, Senegal.;robin.duponnois@ird.sn;Duponnois, Robin/J-7856-2016;;;;;100;31;34;0;36;WILEY-BLACKWELL;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;0168-6496;1574-6941;;FEMS MICROBIOL ECOL;FEMS Microbiol.

Further, the link between the diversity and decomposition rate of two broadleaved, two coniferous and two mixed broadleaved-coniferous litter types was targeted. Litter material was decomposed in litter bags for 4 and 24 months to target both early and late stages of the decomposition. Fungal diversity of L and F layers were also investigated as a parallel to the litter bag method. Temperature gradient gel electrophoresis fingerprinting was used to assess fungal diversity in the samples. Mass loss values and organic and nutrient composition of the litter were also measured. The results showed that the species richness was not strongly affected by the change of the tree species. Nevertheless, the community compositions differed within tree species and decomposition stages. The most important shift was found in the mixed litters from the litter bag treatment for both variables. Both mixed litters displayed the highest species richness (13.3 species both) and the most different community composition as compared to pure litters (6.3-10.7 species) after 24 months. The mass loss after 24 months was similar or greater in the mixed litter (70.5% beech-spruce, 76.2% oak-Douglas-fir litter) than in both original pure litter types. This was probably due to higher niche variability and to the synergistic effect of nutrient transfer between litter types. Concerning pure litter, mass loss values were the highest in oak and beech litter (72.8% and 69.8%) compared to spruce and D. fir (59.4% and 66.5%, respectively). That was probably caused by a more favourable microclimate and litter composition in broadleaved than in coniferous plantations. These variables also seemed to be more important to pure litter decomposition rates than were fungal species richness or community structure.;"[Kubartova, Ariana] SLU, Dept Forest Mycol & Pathol, S-75007 Uppsala, Sweden; [Ranger, Jacques] INRA, Unite Biogeochim Ecosyst Forestiers, Ctr Nancy, F-54280 Champenoux, France; [Berthelin, Jacques; Beguiristain, Thierry] Univ Henri Poincare, CNRS, UMR 7137, LIMOS, F-54506 Vandoeuvre Les Nancy, France";"France; Suede";FRA;Kubartova, A (reprint author), SLU, Dept Forest Mycol & Pathol, POB 7026, S-75007 Uppsala, Sweden.;Ariana.Kubartova@mykopat.slu.se;;;;;;50;54;67;0;69;SPRINGER;NEW YORK;233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA;0095-3628;;;MICROB ECOL;Microb.

Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi are known to influence metal transfer in plants by increasing plant biomass and reducing metal toxicity to plants even if diverging results were reported. The effects of five AM fungi isolated from metal contaminated or non-contaminated soils on metal (Cd, Zn) uptake by plant and transfer to leachates was assessed with Medicago truncatula grown in a multimetallic contaminated agricultural soil. Fungi isolated from metal-contaminated soils were more effective to reduce shoot Cd concentration. Metal uptake capacity differed between AM fungi and depended on the origin of the isolate. Not only fungal tolerance and ability to reduce metal concentrations in plant but also interactions with rhizobacteria affected heavy metal transfer and plant growth. Indeed, thanks to association with nodulating rhizobacteria, one Glomus intraradices inoculum increased particularly plant biomass which allowed exporting twofold more Cd and Zn in shoots as compared to non-mycorrhizal treatment. Cd concentrations in leachates were variable among fungal treatments, but can be significantly influenced by AM inoculation.

Despite the high mycorrhizal frequencies (F%) observed, the presence of arbuscules (A%) was at best low in S. caerulea and T. praecox, and undetectable in L. angustifolium and S. europaea. Temporal temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (TTGE) was applied to field-collected samples from both burdened environments and proved to be an effective technique for rapid profiling and identification of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF). Sequencing and phylogenetic analysis confirmed the association of AMF of the genus Glomus with roots of all four plant species.

These specific and sensitive Real-Time PCR assays were based on the quantification of the copy number of the gene that encodes the alpha subunit of the PAH-ring hydroxylating dioxygenases (PAH-RHD alpha), involved in the initial step of the aerobic metabolism of PAH. The PAH-RHD alpha-GP primer set was designed against the different allele types present in the data base (narAa, phdA/pdoA2, nidA/pdoA1, nidA3/fadA1) common to the Gram positive PAH degraders such as Rhodococcus, Mycobacterium, Nocardioides and Terrabacter strains. The PAH-RHD alpha-GN primer set was designed against the genes (nahAc, nahA3, nagAc, ndoB, ndoC2, pahAc, pahA3, phnAc, phnA1, bphAc, bphA1, dntAc and arhA1) common to the Gram negative PAH degraders such as Pseudomonas, Ralstonia, Commamonas, Burkholderia, Sphingomonas, Alcaligenes, Polaromonas strains. The PCR clones for DNA extracted from soil and sediment samples using the designed primers showed 100% relatedness to the PAH-RHD alpha genes targeted. Deduced from highly sensitive Real-Time PCR quantification, the ratio of PAH-RHD alpha gene relative to the 165 rRNA gene copy number showed that the PAH-bacterial degraders could represent up to 1% of the total bacterial community in the PAH-contaminated sites. This ratio highlighted a positive correlation between the PAH-bacterial biodegradation potential and the PAH-contamination level in the environmental samples studied. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Microbial communities and environmental conditions;MICROBIAL ECOLOGY;;;English;Article;;;;;;;"CONIFEROUS FORESTS; SOIL BIODIVERSITY; LITTER; FUNGI; POPULATIONS; ERGOSTEROL; FERTILITY; DYNAMICS; PATTERNS; BIOMASS";We studied the effect of forest tree species on a community of decomposers that colonize cellulose strips. Both fungal and bacterial communities were targeted in a native forest dominated by beech and oak and 30-year-old beech and spruce plantations, growing in similar ecological conditions in the Breuil-Chenue experimental forest site in Morvan (France). Microbial ingrowths from the 3rd to 10th month of strip decomposition (May to December 2004) were studied. Community composition was assessed using temperature gradient gel electrophoresis with universal fungal (ITS1F, ITS2) and bacterial (1401r, 968f) primers. Soil temperature and moisture as well as fungal biomass were also measured to give additional information on decomposition processes. Changing the dominant tree species had no significant influence in the number of decomposer species. However, decomposer community composition was clearly different. If compared to the native forest, where community composition highly differed, young monocultures displayed similar species structure for fungi and bacteria. Both species numbers and community composition evolved during the decay process. Time effect was found to be more important than tree species. Nevertheless, the actual environmental conditions and seasonal effect seemed to be even more determining factors for the development of microbial communities. The course and correlations of the explored variables often differed between tree species, although certain general trends were identified. Fungal biomass was high in summer, despite that species richness (SR) decreased and conversely, that high SR did not necessarily mean high biomass values. It can be concluded that the growth and development of the microbiological communities that colonized a model material in situ depended on the combination of physical and biological factors acting collectively and interdependently at the forest soil microsite.;"Charles Univ Prague, Fac Sci, Dept Bot, Benatska 2, Prague 12801 2, Czech Republic; INRA, Ctr Nancy, Unite Biogeochim Ecosyst Forestiers, F-54280 Seichamps, France; Univ Henri Poincare, CNRS, LIMOS, UMR 7137, F-54506 Vandoeuvre Les Nancy, France";"France; Republique Tcheque";"FRA; CZE";Kubartova, A (reprint author), Charles Univ Prague, Fac Sci, Dept Bot, Benatska 2, Prague 12801 2, Czech Republic.;arikul@centrum.cz;;;;;;31;18;24;2;42;SPRINGER;NEW YORK;233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA;0095-3628;1432-184X;;MICROB ECOL;Microb.

Rhizosphere is known to increase the biodegradation of PAH but little is known about the biodegradability of these HMW compounds by rhizosphere bacteria. This study compared the effects of a 3 and a 5-ring PAH, phenanthrene (PHE) and dibenzo[a,h]anthracene (dBA) respectively, on the composition of bacterial community, the bacterial density and the biodegradation activity. Compartmentalized devices were designed to harvest three consecutive sections of the rhizosphere. Rhizosphere and non-rhizosphere compartments were filled with PHE or dBA spiked or unspiked sand and inoculated with a soil bacterial inoculum. Different bacterial communities and degradation values were found 5 weeks after spiking with PHE (41-76% biodegradation) and dBA (12-51% biodegradation). In sections closer to the root surface, bacterial populations differed as a function of the distance to roots and the PAH added, whereas in further rhizosphere sections, communities were closer to those of the non-planted treatments. Biodegradation of PHE was also a function of the distance to roots, and decreased from 76 to 42% within 9 mm from the roots. However, biodegradation of dBA was significantly higher in the middle section (3-6 mm from roots) than the others. Rhizosphere degradation of PAH varies with the nature of the PAH, and C fluxes from roots could limit the degradation of dBA.;"UHP Nancy I, CNRS, UMR 7137, LIMOS,Fac Sci, F-54506 Vandoeuvre Les Nancy, France; Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA";"France; Etats-Unis";"FRA; USA";Leyval, C (reprint author), UHP Nancy I, CNRS, UMR 7137, LIMOS,Fac Sci, BP 239, F-54506 Vandoeuvre Les Nancy, France.;corinne.leyval@limos.uhp-nancy.fr;;;;;;38;14;16;1;12;SPRINGER;NEW YORK;233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA;0923-9820;;;BIODEGRADATION;Biodegradation;DEC;2006;17;6;;;;;511;521;;10.1007/s10532-005-9022-x;;;11;Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology;Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology;101NK;WOS:000241747300003;16485083;;;;2020-02-11

The bacterial community after two years was also investigated. Data showed that each tree species, as well as sampling date, displayed the characteristic community structure. There was no strong decrease in microbial species richness or Shannon-Wiener diversity index caused by a change of tree species. Nevertheless, a strong shift in decomposer community structure was evident among the tree species both for fungi and bacteria.

The density and activity of soil bacteria are usually increased in the rhizosphere. A compartmentalized device was used to follow biodegradation of phenanthrene and bacterial community structure as a function of distance from roots. Isolation of total DNA and RNA, followed by PCR-TTGE and RT-PCR-TTGE on a 16S rDNA partial sequence, was performed to describe the structure of bacterial community and of active species, respectively. After 4 weeks, active species profiles in the immediate vicinity of roots were the same as in non-planted treatment, with similar biodegradation efficiency (approx. 60%) whereas community structure clearly indicated that bacterial populations were different. On the opposite, at a furthest distance (6-9mm) from the roots where biodegradation was lower, bacterial community structure was similar to the non-planted treatment whereas active species differed. A specie activity factor (S-af) was calculated for five relevant species to follow their transcriptional state in the rhizosphere and showed spatial variations as a function of species and distance from roots. We conclude that depending on distance from roots, the rhizosphere selected different bacterial communities, and different active species within these communities, resulting in different degradation values. Potential biases of molecular protocols used in this study are discussed as well as their relevance to describe the bacterial component of the rhizosphere involved in PAH biodegradation.

Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi can influence plant survival and PAH degradation in polluted soil. This work was aimed at studying the contribution of the mycorrhizosphere to PAH biodegradation in the presence of ryegrass (Lolium perenne L., cv. Barclay) inoculated with Glomus mosseae (BEG 69) by taking into account the structure and activity of bacterial communities, PAH degrading culturable bacteria as a function of the distance from roots. Ryegrass was grown in compartmentalized systems designed to harvest successive sections of rhizosphere in lateral compartments polluted or not with phenanthrene (PHE). Colonization of roots by G. mosseae (BEG 69) modified the structure and density of bacterial populations in the mycorrhizosphere, compared to the rhizosphere of non-mycorrhizal plants. G. mosseae increased the density of culturable heterotrophic and PAH degrading bacteria beyond the immediate rhizosphere in the presence of PHE, and increased the density of PAH degraders in the absence of the pollutant. Biodegradation was not significantly increased in the mycorrhizosphere, compared to control non-mycorrhizal plants, where PHE biodegradation already reached 92% after 6 weeks. However, dioxygenase transcriptional activity was found to be higher in the immediate mycorrhizosphere in the presence of G. mosseae (BEG 69).;Univ Nancy 1, Fac Sci, CNRS,LIMOS,UMR 7137, Lab Interact Microorganismes Mineraux Mat Organ S, F-54506 Vandoeuvre Les Nancy, France;France;FRA;Leyval, C (reprint author), Univ Nancy 1, Fac Sci, CNRS,LIMOS,UMR 7137, Lab Interact Microorganismes Mineraux Mat Organ S, F-54506 Vandoeuvre Les Nancy, France.;corinne.leyval@limos.uhp-nancy.fr;FONS, Francoise/N-4402-2013;;;;;38;21;24;1;21;SPRINGER;NEW YORK;233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA;0940-6360;1432-1890;;MYCORRHIZA;Mycorrhiza;MAY;2006;16;3;;;;;207;212;;10.1007/s00572-006-0049-6;;;6;Mycology;Mycology;044HY;WOS:000237664200009;16598504;;;;2020-02-11

These exudates constitute an important and constant carbon source that selects microbial populations in the plant rhizosphere, modifying global as well as specific microbial activities. We conducted an experiment in two-compartment devices to show the selection of bacterial communities by root exudates and phenanthrene as a function of distance to roots. Using direct DNA extraction, PCR amplification, and thermal gradient gel electrophoresis screening, bacterial population profiles were analyzed in parallel to bacterial counts and quantification of phenanthrene biodegradation in three layers (0 to 3, 3 to 6, and 6 to 9 mm from root mat) of unplanted-polluted (phenanthrene), planted-polluted, and planted-unpolluted treatments. Bacterial community differed as a function of the distance to roots, in both the presence and the absence of phenanthrene. In the planted and polluted treatment, biodegradation rates showed a strong gradient with higher values near the roots. In the nonplanted treatment, bacterial communities were comparable in the three layers and phenanthrene biodegradation was high. Surprisingly, no biodegradation was detected in the section of planted polluted treatment farthest from the roots, where the bacterial community structure was similar to those of the nonplanted treatment. We conclude that root exudates and phenanthrene induce modifications of bacterial communities in polluted environments and spatially modify the activity of degrading bacteria.;Univ Nancy 1, Fac Sci, UHP, CNRS,LIMOS,UMR 7137, F-54506 Vandoeuvre Les Nancy, France;France;FRA;Leyval, C (reprint author), Univ Nancy 1, Fac Sci, UHP, CNRS,LIMOS,UMR 7137, BP239, F-54506 Vandoeuvre Les Nancy, France.;corinne.leyval@limos.uhp-nancy.fr;;;;;;34;68;72;0;18;AMER SOC MICROBIOLOGY;WASHINGTON;1752 N ST NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036-2904 USA;0099-2240;1098-5336;;APPL ENVIRON MICROB;Appl.

The results presented here show that all three Tnt1 subfamilies are expressed in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) and that the U3 sequence variability correlates with differences in the pattern of expression of the Tnt1 elements. Each of the three Tnt1 subfamilies is induced by stress, but their promoters have a different response to different stress-associated signaling molecules. The Tnt1A subfamily is particularly strongly induced by elicitors and methyl jasmonate, whereas expression on the Tn1C subfamily is more sensitive to salicylic acid and auxins. The direct relationship between U3 sequence variability and differences in the stress-associated expression of the Tnt1 elements present in a single host species gives support to our model that postulates that retrotransposons have adapted to their host genomes through the evolution of highly regulated promoters that mimic those of the stress-induced plant genes. Moreover, here we show that the analysis of the transcriptional control of a retrotransposon population such as Tnt1 provides new insights into the study of the complex and still poorly understood network of defense- and stress-induced plant signal transduction pathways.;"CSIC, Inst Biol Mol Barcelona, Dept Mol Genet, Barcelona, Spain; INRA, Biol Cellulaire Lab, F-78026 Versailles, France";"France; Espagne";"FRA; ESP";Casacuberta, JM (reprint author), CSIC, Inst Biol Mol Barcelona, Dept Mol Genet, Barcelona, Spain.;;Grandbastien, Marie-Angele/K-5491-2013;Casacuberta, josep/0000-0002-5609-4152;;;;42;92;112;0;7;AMER SOC PLANT BIOLOGISTS;ROCKVILLE;15501 MONONA DRIVE, ROCKVILLE, MD 20855 USA;0032-0889;;;PLANT PHYSIOL;Plant Physiol.;SEP;2001;127;1;;;;;212;221;;10.1104/pp.127.1.212;;;10;Plant Sciences;Plant Sciences;474TV;WOS:000171123700026;11553749;Green Published, Bronze;;;2020-02-11

The presence of a strong double enhancer element of the CaMV 35S promoter adjacent to the Ac promoter induced very early excision, directly after transformation into the plant cell, exemplified by the absence of Ac in the T-DNA loci. Excision fingerprint analysis and characterization of transposition events from related regenerants revealed an inverse correlation between the number of excision events and transposed Ac copies, with single early excisions after transformation generating Ac amplification. New transpositions were generated at a frequency of 15-50% in different lines, yielding genotypes bearing multiple insertions, many of which were inherited in the progeny. The sequence of DNA flanking Ac in three representative lines provided a database of insertion tagged sites suitable for the identification of mutants of sequenced genes that can be examined for phenotypes in a reverse genetics strategy to elucidate gene function. Remarkably, two-thirds of Ac tagged sites showing homology to sequences in public databases were in predicted genes. A clear preference of transposon insertions in genes that are either predicted by protein coding capacity or by similarity to ESTs suggests that the efficiency of recovering knockout mutants of genes could be about three times higher than random.

At inhibitory concentrations (100 muM), hypaphorine induced a transitory swelling of root hair tips of Eucalyptus globulus Labill. ssp. bicostata. When the polar tip growth resumed, a characteristic deformation was still visible on elongating hairs. At higher hypaphorine concentrations (500 muM and greater), root hair elongation stopped, only 15 min after application. However, root hair initiation from trichoblasts was not affected by hypaphorine. Hypaphorine activity could not be mimicked by related molecules such as indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) or tryptophan. While IAA had no activity on root hair elongation, IAA was able to restore the tip growth of root hairs following inhibition by hypaphorine. These results suggest that hypaphorine and endogenous IAA counteract in controlling root hair elongation.

This phenomenon, observed 24 h after inoculation, was also recorded in several-month-old, well-established ectomycorrhizas. Accumulation was controlled by specific root-derived diffusible molecules: it can be induced through a membrane, but not by non-host plants. In pure culture, high hypaphorine concentration was found only in the youngest mycelium, i.e. the outer 2 mm of the colony. Fungal hypaphorine had no IAA-like activity on Eucalyptus root development and therefore could not be considered as an auxin analogue; instead, a strong reduction of root hair elongation was recorded.";INRA,CTR NANCY,EQUIPE MICROBIOL FORESTIERE,F-54280 CHAMPENOUX,FRANCE;France;FRA;;;;;;;;30;45;47;0;8;CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS;NEW YORK;40 WEST 20TH STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10011-4211;0028-646X;;;NEW PHYTOL;New Phytol.;JUL;1997;136;3;;;;;525;532;;10.1046/j.1469-8137.1997.00753.x;;;8;Plant Sciences;Plant Sciences;XN490;WOS:A1997XN49000014;;;;;2020-02-11
